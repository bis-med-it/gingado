Romania,2015-01-07,"The analysis of the latest macroeconomic data points to a decline in the annual inflation rate, which followed a path lower than previously forecasted, due to the drop in volatile prices, subdued euro area inflation, the persistence of the negative output gap, and to the ongoing downward adjustment in inflation expectations. The annual inflation rate stood at 1.26 percent in November 2014, down from 1.44 percent a month earlier. The average annual inflation rate came in at 1.1 percent in November 2014, slightly below the previous month's reading of 1.2 percent, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union  remained unchanged at 1.4 percent. Foreign exchange reserves remained around EUR 32 billion at end-2014 after making external debt service payments worth about EUR 8 billion and lowering the minimum reserve requirement ratio on credit institutions' foreign currency-denominated liabilities to 14 percent from 20 percent. The reserves were fuelled by inflows of European funds and government borrowings in international markets. During 2014, the exchange rate of the leu against the euro witnessed stable developments, with the March-October appreciation being mitigated by heightened global risk aversion amid geopolitical tensions in the region over the final months of the year. The real growth rate of domestic currency loans picked up thanks to the pass-through of the successive policy rate cuts onto lending rates on new business to companies and households. However, the real annual dynamics of credit to the private sector remained in negative territory, against the background of the contraction in foreign currency credit (stocks) and the ongoing operations to remove non-performing loans from credit institutions' balance sheets. Looking at the real economy, the latest statistical data point to a step-up in the annual dynamics of gross domestic product amid the recovery of domestic demand, fostered by both its major components, i.e. consumption and investment. Over the short term, the path of the annual inflation rate is expected to remain below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target, as a result of the influence exerted by developments in the global oil price and the persistence of the negative output gap. At the same time, there is heightened uncertainty surrounding external developments owing to resurgent geopolitical tensions in the region and to monetary policy stance adjustments by major central banks worldwide. Against this background, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 2.5 percent per annum from 2.75 percent starting with 8 January 2015, to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to keep unchanged the current levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on liabilities of credit institutions. With a view to consolidating the transmission of the policy rate signal, the NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±2.25 percentage points from ±2.5 percentage points. Therefore, starting with 8 January 2015, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, while the deposit facility rate will remain at 0.25 percent per annum. Based on currently available data, these decisions are meant to ensure price stability over the medium term, along with the sustainable recovery of lending, which is likely to help achieve balanced and lasting economic growth. The NBR Board believes that an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, in line with external financing arrangements, together with a sustainable financial intermediation and an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits are pivotal to consolidating the Romanian economy and enhancing its resilience to external shocks. The NBR is restating that the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools, amid close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, will ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. In line with the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 4 February 2015, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Mongolia,2015-01-14,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Monetary policy decision Number: 2015/01 Effective date: 15 January 2015 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia decided to increase policy interest rate by 1.0 percentage point to 13%, at its recurrent meeting on January 14, 2015. Although, annual inflation measured by CPI declined to 11.0% nationwide at the end of 2014 owing to sustainable positive change in the composition of inflation over the last two years, core inflation remains high at 12.6% due to impacts of exchange rate fluctuation and increase in administered prices. In addition, foreign exchange inflows remain muted and foreign direct investments have been deteriorating for the third consecutive year. Therefore, the MPC took this policy action to support external macroeconomic balance through increasing togrog yield until signs of improvement on terms of trade condition and foreign exchange inflows are noted. The decision shall positively affect reducing aggregate demand and current account deficit in the short term, maintaining inflation at low and stable level, and promoting macroeconomic and financial stability. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Poland,2015-01-14,"Warsaw, 14 January 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 13-14 January 2015 The Council has decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at:  reference rate at 2.00% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 3.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.25% on an annual basis. Global economic activity growth remains moderate, although the situation varies across countries. The United States observed continued recovery in 2014 Q4, and the data on GDP in 2014 Q3 have been revised upwards. In contrast, activity growth in the euro area has continued to be slow, and the 2015 growth forecasts have been revised downwards in the recent months. In the largest emerging economies, economic activity growth has also remained weak as for these countries. Russia's output growth has probably decreased close to zero. In the past month, oil prices continued to decline sharply. Along with the moderate global economic growth, this has been conducive to inflation persisting at very low levels in many countries, and contributed to deflation occurring in the euro area. Major central banks continue their expansionary monetary policy and keep interest rates at historically low levels. The ECB and the Bank of Japan are running asset purchase programmes. At the same time, expectations of a gradual interest rate increase in the United States have strengthened which have contributed to a depreciation of the emerging market currencies, including the zloty. Heightened risk aversion in the international financial markets persists. In Poland, economic activity growth in 2014 Q4 may have slowed down slightly. In November, industrial output growth decreased to near-zero levels, while construction and assembly output continued to fall. At the same time, retail sales growth decreased. Growth in bank lending  both to enterprises and households  continued at a steady pace. Labour market data point to a further rise in corporate employment, which supports the decline in seasonally-adjusted unemployment. At the same time, wage pressure remains limited, as indicated by continued moderate wage growth in the corporate sector. In November. CPI inflation remained negative and was below expectations at -0.6% y/y. This was accompanied by a decrease in the majority of core inflation indices, which confirms the absence of demand pressure in the economy. The decline in producer prices has also continued, indicating a lack of cost pressure in the economy. This is accompanied by very low inflation expectations of enterprises and households. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council highlights that uncertainty regarding economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy persists. If the expected period of deflation extends, which would increase the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term, and incoming data confirm a slowdown in economic activity as well as weak growth in the environment of the Polish economy persists, the Council does not rule out further adjustment of monetary policy."
Chile,2015-01-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 January 2015 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, the downward trend of the prices of commodities continued, with a further decline in the oil price and a drop in the price of copper. External financial conditions for the emerging economies deteriorated, while long-term rates in developed economies declined and the dollar continued to appreciate. Meanwhile, recent information confirms the outlook of good economic performance in the United States and slower growth and low inflation in the Eurozone and Japan, a development that has widened the differences in expected paths of monetary policy implemented by those economies. Output and demand indicators continue to reveal the low growth of the Chilean economy, in accordance with the December's Monetary Policy Report´s baseline scenario. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined and nominal wages remain dynamic. Local financial conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. Annual inflation dropped, while core indicators kept at the same level. Medium-term inflation expectations remain around 3%. The evolution of prices will continue to be monitored with special attention. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2015-01-15,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release January 15, 2015 In its meeting held on January 15, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 925 percen. Headline CPI decelerated by 153 percent (m/m) and 007 percent (m/m) in November and December, respectivel. This brought the annual inflation rates to 909 percent in November then to 1013 percent in December due to an unfavorable base effec. The monthly developments came broadly on the back of the seasonal deceleration in the prices of fruits and vegetables coupled with the decline in the prices of other food items supported by the decrease in international price. On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 03 percent (m/m) in December after declining by 015 percent (m/m) in Novembe. The annual rate continued to ease registering 769 percent in December following 781 in Novembe. Upside risks from imported inflation continue to be contained on the back of lower oil prices and the consequent revision in international food price forecast. Meanwhile real GDP jumped significantly in 2014/15 Q1, registering at 68 percent the highest annual growth rate since 2007/08 Q4. This comes atier the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth rate recorded 22 percen. Notwithstanding the support stemming from the base effect, the expansion in economic activity during 2014/2015 Q1 came on the back of the continuous growth in the manufacturing sector and the expansion of tourism activities after several quarters of contractio. This came despite the continuous weakness in the extraction secto. In the meantime, investment continued to improve for the third consecutive quarte. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GD. In light of recent global developments and the reassessment of risks surrounding the inflation outlook and domestic GDP, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rate. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

South Korea,2015-01-15,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area has continued while economic growth in emerging market countries such as China has slowed somewhat. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in the euro area and China, by financial and economic unrest in the oil-producing countries, and by geopolitical risks. Looking at the Korean economy, while export growth has slowed somewhat the Committee judges that the recovery of domestic demand has not been strong and the sentiments of economic agents remain weak. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, but that the negative output gap will persist for a considerable time. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.0% the month before to 0.8% in December, due mainly to an increase in the scale of decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices registered 1.6%, as in November. Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise from the second half of this year, after remaining at a low level despite the hike in cigarette prices under the influence for example of international oil price movements. In the housing market, leasehold deposit and sales prices continued their uptrends— centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas in the former case and around the rest of the country in the latter. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen due for example to stock price declines in other major countries and to the net selling of domestic stocks by foreigners. After rising, long-term market interest rates have fallen back. The Korean won has appreciated against the US dollar, due mainly to the widening of the current account surplus and to a slowdown in Japanese yen depreciation, while appreciating against the yen as the synchronization between movements of the won and the yen has weakened. Bank household lending has sustained its substantial uptrend, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows."
Peru,2015-01-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2015 BCRP LOWERED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE FROM 3.50% TO 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will be converging more rapidly to the 2.0 percent target in 2015. This forecast also takes into account that: economic activity continues showing levels below its potential levels; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range; recent international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as increased volatility in financial markets, and the lower international prices of crude oil have started to gradually reflect in the domestic market. This interest rate reduction does not imply successive interest rate cuts. Inflation in December showed a rate of 0.23 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.16 percent in November to 3.22 percent in December. Inflation without food and energy registered a rate of 0.49 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 2.49 percent in November to 2.51 percent in December. Recent indicators of activity continue showing a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output rates in 2014 and significant drops in the rates of primary activities due to negative supply factors. In January, the BCRP has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 9.5 to 9.0 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.05 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of February will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on February 12, 2015."
Turkiye,2015-01-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 8.25 percent to 7.75 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 12.75 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures continue to have favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation) indicators, and inflation expectations. Moreover, declining commodity prices, in particular oil prices, contribute to disinflation. In light of these positive developments, the Committee has decided on a measured cut in the one week repo rate. Under the current monetary policy stance, the Committee anticipates that inflation will decline to levels close to the target by mid-2015. Yet, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy. In this context, future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Armenia,2015-01-21,"PRESS RELEASE 21.01.2015 At the January 21, 2015 ad hoc meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to raise the refinancing rate by 1.00 pp to 9.50%. Inflation in December 2014 was 3.0%, with the 12‐month inflation having amounted to 4.6%. In the external sector, after the latest decision on the refinancing rate, deflationary trends persisted in the main commodity and food product markets. To which extent and at which speed these trends will reflect price changes in relevant domestic markets in Armenia is still uncertain. Deflationary pressures were also observed in trading partner countries, with the exception of Russia, where the ruble's unprecedented depreciation late in the year prompted an upside adjustment of prices. Though high inflationary expectations in the domestic economy in late 2014 have somewhat moderated, these are still persisting, which is reflected in the financial market as businesses demonstrate a demand for increased interest rates on dram instruments. The Board of the Central Bank believes that existing high interest rates which were shaped around the CBA Lombard Repo Facility rate encompass the trend of rising world interest rates and risk premium in developing countries over the long‐term. In view of maintaining the position of monetary policy, the Board finds it appropriate to increase the refinancing rate. At the same time, to reduce currently high market rates, the Board lowered the Lombard Repo Facility rate by 3 percentage points to 17%. As pressures in the foreign currency market are easing, this will help neutralize high inflationary expectations and achieve the fulfillment of the inflation target. The Board's next decision on the monetary policy directions will be held on February 10th this year, according to the schedule. The decision will be followed by the publication of the first quarter 2015 monetary policy program in which the Central Bank will focus in more detail on recent developments and forecasts of the upcoming period. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… Press Service of the Central Bank."
Euroarea,2015-01-22,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Lithuania as the nineteenth country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly. Mr Vasiliauskas, the Chairman of the Board of Lietuvos bankas, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2015. The accession of Lithuania to the euro area on 1 January 2015 triggered a system under which NCB governors take turns holding voting rights on the Governing Council. The details on this rotation system are available on the ECB's website. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we conducted a thorough reassessment of the outlook for price developments and of the monetary stimulus achieved. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions:. First, it decided to launch an expanded asset purchase programme, encompassing the existing purchase programmes for asset-backed securities and covered bonds. Under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector securities will amount to €60 billion. They are intended to be carried out until end-September 2016 and will in any case be conducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In March 2015 the Eurosystem will start to purchase euro-denominated investment-grade securities issued by euro area governments and agencies and European institutions in the secondary market. The purchases of securities issued by euro area governments and agencies will be based on the Eurosystem NCBs' shares in the ECB's capital key. Some additional eligibility criteria will be applied in the case of countries under an EU/IMF adjustment programme. Second, the Governing Council decided to change the pricing of the six remaining targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). Accordingly , the interest rate applicable to future TLTRO operations will be equal to the rate on the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations prevailing at the time when each TLTRO is conducted, thereby removing the 10 basis point spread over the MRO rate that applied to the first two TLTROs. Third, in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards the additional asset purchases, the Governing Council retains control over all the design features of the programme and the ECB will coordinate the purchases, thereby safeguarding the singleness of the Eurosystem's monetary policy. The Eurosystem will make use of decentralised implementation to mobilise its resources. With regard to the sharing of hypothetical losses, the Governing Council decided that purchases of securities of European institutions (which will be 12% of the additional asset purchases, and which will be purchased by NCBs) will be subject to loss sharing. The rest of the NCBs' additional asset purchases will not be subject to loss sharing. This implies that 20% of the additional asset purchases will be subject to a regime of risk sharing. Separate press releases with more detailed information on the expanded asset purchase programme and the pricing of the TLTROs will be published this afternoon at 3.30 p.m. Today's monetary policy decision on additional asset purchases was taken to counter two unfavourable developments. First, inflation dynamics have continued to be weaker than expected. While the sharp fall in oil prices over recent months remains the dominant factor driving current headline inflation, the potential for second-round effects on wage and price-setting has increased and could adversely affect medium-term price developments. This assessment is underpinned by a further fall in market-based measures of inflation expectations over all horizons and the fact that most indicators of actual or expected inflation stand at, or close to, their historical lows. At the same time, economic slack in the euro area remains sizeable and money and credit developments continue to be subdued. Second, while the monetary policy measures adopted between June and September last year resulted in a material improvement in terms of financial market prices, this was not the case for the quantitative results. As a consequence, the prevailing degree of monetary accommodation was insufficient to adequately address heightened risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. Thus, today the adoption of further balance sheet measures has become warranted to achieve our price stability objective, given that the key ECB interest rates have reached their lower bound. Looking ahead, today's measures will decisively underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. The sizeable increase in our balance sheet will further ease the monetary policy stance. In particular, financing conditions for firms and households in the euro area will continue to improve. Moreover, today's decisions will support our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. Taken together, these factors should strengthen demand, increase capacity utilisation and support money and credit growth, and thereby contribute to a return of inflation rates towards 2%. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2014. The latest data and survey evidence point to continued moderate growth at the turn of the year. Looking ahead, recent declines in oil prices have strengthened the basis for the economic recovery to gain momentum. Lower oil prices should support households' real disposable income and corporate profitability. Domestic demand should also be further supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. However, the euro area recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside, but should have diminished after today's monetary policy decisions and the continued fall in oil prices over recent weeks. According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation was -0.2% in December 2014, after 0.3% in November. This decline mainly reflects a sharp fall in energy price inflation and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the annual rate of change in food prices. On the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for oil, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain very low or negative in the months ahead. Such low inflation rates are unavoidable in the short term, given the recent very sharp fall in oil prices and assuming that no significant correction will take place in the next few months. Supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected recovery in demand and the assumption of a gradual increase in oil prices in the period ahead, inflation rates are expected to increase gradually later in 2015 and in 2016. The Governing Council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on geopolitical developments, exchange rate and energy price developments, and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data indicate a pick-up in underlying growth in broad money (M3), although it remains at low levels. The annual growth rate of M3 increased to 3.1% in November 2014, up from 2.5% in October and a trough of 0.8% in April 2014. Annual growth in M3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 6.9% in November. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained weak at -1.3% in November 2014, compared with -1.6% in October, while continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in February 2014. On average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago and net lending flows turned slightly positive in November. In this respect, the January 2015 bank lending survey indicates a further net easing of credit standards in the fourth quarter of 2014, with cross-country disparities decreasing in parallel with an increase in net demand for loans across all loan categories. Despite these improvements, lending to non-financial corporations remains weak and continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.7% in November, after 0.6% in October. Our monetary policy measures should support a further improvement in credit flows. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary policy accommodation. All our monetary policy measures should provide support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates closer to levels below, but close to, 2%. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to increase investment activity, boost job creation and raise productivity growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. In particular, the determined implementation of product and labour market reforms as well as actions to improve the business environment for firms needs to gain momentum in several countries. It is crucial that structural reforms be implemented swiftly, credibly and effectively as this will not only increase the future sustainable growth of the euro area, but will also raise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today and bring forward the economic recovery. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while ensuring debt sustainability in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, which remains the anchor for confidence. All countries should use the available scope for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Israel,2015-01-26,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The inflation rate for 2014 was negative 0.2 percent, led by declines in the food, fruit and vegetables, furniture and household equipment, and clothing and footwear components. The direct contribution of energy components to the decline in the CPI was 0.3 percentage points. Housing was the only component that increased significantly in 2014. The tradable goods components of the CPI declined by 1.9 percent. CPI components representing nontradable items increased by 0.7 percent in 2014 against the background of the increase in the housing component. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December was unchanged, while forecasters projected an increase of 0.1%, on average. Similar to the previous month, the clothing and footwear component increased markedly, and the fruit and vegetables component declined notably, both due to seasonal factors. In addition, there were also significant declines in December in the furniture and household equipment component and the education, culture and entertainment component. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The reductions of water prices in January, together with the reduction of electricity rates that was deferred to February, are expected to reduce the inflation rate by about 0.4 percent in a one-off effect. This month as well,one-year inflation expectations (seasonally adjusted) derived from the capital market were volatile, and in recent days they declined to 0.4 percent,while expectations for two years declined to 0.7 percent. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings remained 0.6 percent,on average. Expectations for the coming 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates remained around 0.35 percent. Medium-termforward expectations declined by 0.3 percentage points this month and expectations for longer terms increased by about 0.2 percentage points. The makam and Telbor curves declined this month, and both indicate a low probability that the Bank of Israel interest rate will be reduced in the coming months, but the average projections of private forecasters do not indicate such a reduction. Real economic activity: Indicators that became available this month continue to point to an acceleration of activity in the fourth quarter, after a slowdown in the third quarter resulting from Operation Protective Edge. According to trend data, goods exports (in dollar terms, excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter, which included an increase of 1.5 percent in low technology industries' exports, which are affected to a greater extent by the depreciation of the shekel. Business services exports increased by 0.4 percent in October and a recovery in tourism continued in December. There was growth in all import components in December, partially as a resultof one-time growth in imports of vehicles ahead of changes in taxation coming into effect, and also partly due to an increase in raw materials imports. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.3 percent in December, against the background of increases in foreign trade indices and in the number of job vacancies. Composite Index data for previous months were revised upward, and most of the gap between the development of the index in 2014 and its long-term trend was closed. The Companies Survey indicates improvement in all industries in the fourth quarter, and here too the improvement in low technology industries was notable. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim remained stable in December, while the ConsumerConfidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics is still at a negative level, reflecting consumer pessimism. Bank Hapoalim's Purchasing Managers Index declined to 45.8 points, in view of the expected decline in sales to the domestic market. The business sector Climate Index continues to indicate a monthly growth rate lower than that recorded prior toOperation Protective Edge. The labor market: Data that became available this month continue to indicate a positive picture in the labor market. The number of employee posts increased by 0.4 percent in August-October (trend data in annual terms), compared with 0.3 percent in May-July. The increase occurred in public services as well as in the business sector, where the increase was more prominent in the services industries than in manufacturing. Nominal and real wages increased in August-October by 0.7 percent, compared with May-July (seasonally adjusted data). The Knesset approved raising the minimum wage in three increments, and it will rise in April from NIS 4,300 to NIS 4,650 per month. Health tax receipts continued to increase at a stable rate, and were 4.5 percent higher (in nominal terms) in November-December than in the correspondingperiod of last year. The job vacancy rate increased sharply in November: December. Budget data: The total deficit (excluding net credit) in 2014 was about 2.8 percent of GDP, slightly below the deficit ceiling of 3 percent, primarily as a result of underperformance of civilian expenditures. Excluding exceptional revenue, tax revenue was NIS 252.5 billion, only about NIS 0.3 billion lower than the budget forecast. Government revenue from direct taxes increased at a relatively rapid rate in the final quarter of the year, and indirect tax receipts returned to their pre-Operation Protective Edge level. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on December 28, 2014, through January 23, 2015, the shekel strengthened by 6.5 percent against the euro, and weakened by 1.4 percent against the dollar. The shekel appreciated by about 1.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. After a depreciation of 10.4 percent from August in effective exchange rate terms, there has been an effective appreciation of 4.4 percent since December, so that the cumulative depreciation since August has been 5.5 percent. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on December 28, 2014, through January 23, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 0.5 percent. Government bond yields declined on both the CPI-indexed curve and the unindexed curve. The yield on unindexed 10-year bonds declined by around 60 basis points, to a low of 1.85 percent, and the yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities remained essentially unchanged at about 5 basis points. Makam yields declined by about 5 basis points along the entire curve. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained virtually unchanged, at about 80 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in December, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 35.6 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.4 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 10 billion (1.2 percent) inNovember, to NIS 824 billion, primarily as a result of credit raised from abroad and the effect of the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar.In December, the business sector issued about NIS 2.2 billion in bonds in Israel, higher than in the previous two months, but lower than the monthly average for 2014 of NIS 3.4 billion. In January, there was a moderate amount of negative net new investment by the public in corporate bond mutual funds and in general bond funds, compared with a large amount of withdrawals in December. Corporate bond market spreads continued to decline, in all industries, with the decline in the investments and holdings industries particularly prominent. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 3.3 billion (0.8 percent) in November, to about NIS 435 billion. Of that, outstanding housing debt increased by about NIS 1.5 billion. In December, against the background of the cancellation of the plan for zero VAT on new homes, about NIS 5.5 billion in new mortgages were taken out, compared with a monthlyaverage of about NIS 4.3 billion in 2014. The interest rate on new CPI-indexed variable-rate mortgages increased by 0.24 percentage points in December, while it declined by 0.1 percentage points on the unindexed, fixed-rate,track. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.1 percent in December, and by 3.1 percent in 2014. In October-November, home prices increased by 0.2 percent, and in the 12 months ending in November, they increased by 5.8 percent, compared with 6.1 percent in the 12 months ending in October. The trend of decline in the number of transactions has continued in recent months, though it was concentrated in the purchases of second-handhomes. The number of new home purchases, particularly those in the price range that would have been included in the zero-VAT plan, has increased sharply since September, and between August and November there was a moderate decline in the number of new homes available for sale. The pace of building starts and building completions remains relatively high. The global economy: The IMF reduced its forecasts for 2015 and 2016 this month, primarily against the background ofthe weakness becoming apparent in developing economies (the projection forthose countries was reduced by 0.6 percentage points for 2015), and despite the improvement in projected US growth and the decline in energy prices. The projection for advanced economies was revised upward by 0.1 percentage points, and projected growth in world trade volume was reduced by 1.1 percentage points. In the US, growth is expected to be based on an increase in personal consumption expenditure and continued accommodative monetary policy. The US labor market continues to improve, with a rapid increase in the number of employed people and a continued decline in the unemployment rate. Despite assessments that the decline in inflation in the US seems temporary,interest-rate futures contracts indicate a market assessment that the datewhen the federal funds rate is increased will likely be pushed off. In Europe, marked weakness in economic activity continues. Inflation measured over the preceding 12 months turned negative, and the ECB announced a quantitative easing program in which it will purchase E 282 AC 60 billion of government bonds per month. Due to that announcement, euro weakness continues, and the currency reached a low of more than a decade against the dollar. The Swiss National Bank, in a surprise announcement, said that it would discontinue the minimum exchange rate and would reduce the interest rate to negative 0.75 percent. As a result the Swiss franc appreciated by tens of percent. Interest rates were reduced in other countries, including Canada. Denmark. India, and Turkey. In China, it is expected that the government will revise growth targets downward. On global financial markets, government bond yields reached new lows in most major economies, against the background of monetary expansion and low growth. Equities markets traded mixed: the energy sector and company reports dragged US indices to declines, and the expectation of quantitative easing led to increases in Europe. Commodity prices continued to decline, with the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil declining to below $50. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for February 2015 unchanged at 0.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel'smonetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. Thepath of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate ofthe shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. v The CPI was unchanged in December. Inflation expectations for short terms are below the lower bound of the target range, among other things against the background of continued declines in energy prices around the world and the expected effect of the reductions in water and electricity prices. v Indicators that became available this month continue to point to an acceleration of activity in the fourth quarter, after a slowdown in the third quarter resulting from Operation Protective Edge. Fourth quarter Companies Survey data indicate improvement in most industries, with a notable upturn in low technology industries, which are affected more by the exchange rate. In recent months there hasbeen a step up in the rate of growth of the Composite State of the EconomyIndex. Labor market data continued to indicate a positive picture. v Against the background of exceptional developments in global foreign exchange markets, the shekel strengthened by 6.5 percent vis-C 3A 0-vis the euro and weakened against the dollar by 1.3 percent this month. After a depreciation of 10.4 percent from August in the effective exchange rate, there has been an effective appreciation of 4.4 percent since December, so that the cumulative depreciation since August has been 5.5 percent. v In Europe, a large-scale quantitative easing program was announced, and interest rates were reduced in several countries. This month, the IMF reduced its projections for global growth and world trade volume development; the forecast for US growth was revised upward. Prices of energy and other commodities continued to decline this month, which is expected to support the recovery of growth in major economies and to work toward continued declines in inflation. v The number of new home purchases, particularly of homes in the price range that would have been included in the zero-VAT plan, has increased sharply since September, and from August through November there has been a moderate decline in the number of new homes available for sale. The rate of new mortgages taken out continues to be very high. v Net withdrawals from corporate bond funds continued, though at a more moderate rate, and market spreads are stable. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the current level of the interest rate supports the continuation of the recovery in economic activity, and the return of inflation to within the targetrange. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for February 2015 will be published on February 9, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for March 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 23, 2015."
Hungary,2015-01-27,"At its meeting on 27 January 2015, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 2.10%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pick-up in the components of domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, the unemployment rate continues to exceed its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for December, consumer prices show historically low dynamics. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets, moderated path of commodity prices and imported inflation, the degree of unused capacity in the economy, subdued wage dynamics and the moderation in inflation expectations. The continued decline in oil prices and the fall in processed food prices have contributed to the further easing in inflation. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. However, domestic demand-side disinflationary pressures are likely to weaken significantly in the second half of the forecast period as activity gathers pace, and inflation is likely to reach levels around 3 per cent consistent with price stability in the latter half of the forecast period. In the Council's judgement, economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. Industrial output continued to grow and the trade surplus rose. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable or increasing slightly in recent months. Looking ahead, domestic demand is likely to be the main engine of growth. The prolonged Funding for Growth Scheme is likely to promote corporate investment this year, but weak global economic activity and lower receipts of EU funding are likely to work in the opposite direction. Household consumption is also likely to pick up gradually, mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. According to seasonally adjusted data, employment was broadly unchanged in November, with the increase in the number of those employed under public employment programmes also playing a role. International investor sentiment has been volatile since the Council's latest interest rate decision, with risk aversion dominating financial markets. Global sentiment deteriorated significantly at the end of the year, due to the turbulence in Russian financial markets and the political events in Greece. Then, following a temporary improvement, global risk appetite fell again from the middle of the month, reflecting the further decline in oil prices, and the surprise announcement by the Swiss National Bank. The European Central Bank has decided to extend its asset purchase programme aiming to bring euro-area inflation into line with the inflation target corresponding to price stability. International factors were a major factor behind movements in the forint exchange rate. Domestic risk measures were little changed as the temporary effects of the financial market turbulence at the end of the year dissipated. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. The Swiss franc has appreciated significantly against the forint and other currencies after the Swiss National Bank announced that it had abandoned the franc's peg against the euro. The exchange rate at which Hungarian foreign currency-denominated household mortgage loans would be converted into forints was fixed in advance in November 2014. In agreement with the MNB's proposal, the conversion was effected in a single step for all households with foreign currency-denominated household mortgage loans. The MNB provided nearly EUR 9 billion liquidity required for settlements and forint conversions, thereby allowing time for participants of the domestic financial system to manage exchange rate risk. Therefore, the appreciation of the Swiss franc may affect the domestic banking sector mainly through losses incurred on Swiss franc-denominated corporate loans and household loans unaffected by the conversion. That, however, is expected to have a moderate impact and is not to pose systemic stability risk. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead, therefore, the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish. Based on data available since the latest policy decision, there has been a shift towards the alternative scenario implying looser monetary policy published in the December 2014 Inflation Report. With current monetary conditions maintained, there have been no second-round effects despite disinflationary trends in external markets, and therefore inflation is likely to move into line with the target in the second half of the forecast horizon. The Council judges that, based on available information, the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, achieving the medium-term inflation target points in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period."
Malaysia,2015-01-28,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. While the global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, there has been increasing divergence in the growth momentum among the major economies. For most of Asia, growth is supported by the continued expansion in both domestic and external demand. Looking ahead, despite the varying impacts of the significantly lower oil prices on economies, the overall global economy is expected to benefit from this development. Nevertheless, the downside risk to the global economic outlook has increased following the weakening growth momentum in a number of major economies due to external and domestic specific factors. Volatility in the international financial markets has increased amid shifts in global liquidity and heightened uncertainty particularly with regard to global growth prospects and the decline in commodity prices. While the Malaysian financial markets have been affected by these global developments, there has been no disruption to financial intermediation. There remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The banking institutions are operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers, and continue to provide financing to the economy. For Malaysia, economic activity continues to be supported by growth in domestic demand amid a moderation in exports in the fourth quarter of 2014. Going forward, domestic demand will remain as the key driver of growth. While private consumption is expected to moderate, it will remain supported by the steady rise in income and employment, and the additional disposable income from the lower oil prices. Investment activity is projected to remain resilient, with broad-based capital spending by both the private and public sectors cushioning the lower oil and gas-related investment activity. While export growth will be affected by lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve. The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to still remain on a steady growth path. Inflation for 2015 is expected to be lower than earlier anticipated due to the lower energy and commodity prices. The projected lower energy prices will partially offset other domestic cost factors. With the implementation of the managed float pricing mechanism for fuel, the outlook for headline inflation would be subjected to the volatility of oil prices. Nevertheless, the expectation is for underlying inflation to remain relatively stable, amid the more moderate demand conditions. At the current level, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and is assessed to be appropriate given the developments in monetary and financial conditions. The MPC will continue to carefully assess the external developments and their implications on the Malaysian economy. The MPC will also continue to monitor the risks of destabilising financial imbalances. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 28 January 2015."
United States,2015-01-28,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish. Household spending is rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power. Business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Inflation has declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined substantially in recent months; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to decline further in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Jerome H Powell; Daniel K Tarullo; and John C Williams."
South Africa,2015-01-29,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 29 January 2015 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the inflation outlook has been dominated by the further decline in international oil prices, from around US$75 per barrel in late November to current levels of around US$46 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices declined by almost R2 per litre over the period (and over R3 per litre since August), and a further sizeable decrease is expected in February. This decline in domestic prices occurred despite some offsetting effects from a further depreciation of the rand against the US dollar. The near-term inflation outlook has therefore changed significantly, but the favourable impact of these developments on both inflation and growth in the longer term will depend on the persistence of the oil price decline. Even a moderate increase in oil prices going forward will reverse the favourable inflation trajectory, and the inflation and growth benefits, while welcome, are expected to be temporary. At the same time, the impact of load shedding and a deterioration of the global 1. At the same time, the impact of load shedding and a deterioration of the global 1 growth outlook are likely to offset some of the positive impacts of the lower petrol price on domestic growth. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas maintained its recent downward trend and measured 5,8 per cent and 5,3 per cent in November and December respectively, down from its recent peak of 6,6 per cent in May and June 2014. This trend reflected continued moderation in food and petrol prices. Food price inflation measured 7,4 per cent in December, down from 7,7 per cent in November, while petrol prices declined by 5,5 per cent. By contrast, core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, remained near the upper end of the inflation target range, but moderated to 5,7 per cent in December from 5,8 per cent previously. Headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods was also favourably impacted by declining oil and agricultural crop prices, and measured 6,5 per cent and 5,8 per cent in November and December respectively compared with 6,9 per cent and 6,7 per cent in the preceding two months. The decline in international oil prices has prompted a downward revision of the oil price assumption in the Bank's forecasting model, with a significant impact on the near-term inflation forecast. The longer term impact will be dependent on the persistence of these lower prices, which have been a reaction to global supply and demand factors as well as a change in the behavior of key oil producers. With supply still plentiful and global growth prospects remaining relatively subdued, lower oil 2. With supply still plentiful and global growth prospects remaining relatively subdued, lower oil 2 prices are expected to persist for some time. However, our forecast makes provision for a moderate increase over the next two years. Having averaged 6,1 per cent in 2014, inflation is now expected to average 3,8 per cent in 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 5,3 per cent, and to reach a low of 3,5 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with 5,1 per cent previously. The steep decline in 2015, however, produces a strong base effect in 2016, and, when combined with a slightly higher oil price assumption and a depreciated nominal effective exchange rate of the rand, results in an average inflation forecast of 5,4 per cent for the year (5,5 per cent previously), and 5,3 per cent in the final quarter. The impact on core inflation is far less pronounced. Core inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent and 5,1 per cent in 2015 and 2016 respectively, from 5,7 per cent and 5,3 per cent previously. The peak is expected at 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University moderated from 6,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2014 to 5,8 per cent in the final quarter. Analysts and trade unionists revised their forecasts for 2015 downwards by 0,3 percentage points to 5,4 per cent and 5,9 per cent respectively, while the forecasts of business people were 0,2 percentage points lower at 6,2 per cent. Forecasts for 2016 are unchanged for the latter category, but both analysts and trade unionists expect a 0,1 percentage point increase in 2016 relative to 2015. While this downward revision is a welcome development, it is too early to assess whether or not this represents the start of a 3. While this downward revision is a welcome development, it is too early to assess whether or not this represents the start of a 3 sustained downward trend. At these levels, expectations still remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. According to the Reuters poll of economic analysts conducted in January, the median inflation expectation is 5,0 per cent in 2015, rising to 5,5 per cent in 2016. The low point of the inflation trend is expected in the second quarter, with the median at 4,6 per cent, but with expectations ranging from 3,4 per cent to 5,9 per cent. Inflation expectations as reflected in inflation linked bonds have been volatile, having increased in response to the weaker exchange rate in November, but since mid- December have exhibited a steep decline. Both the 5-year and 10-year break-even rates have declined to levels below 5,5 per cent. The global economic growth outlook remains mixed, despite a strong performance by the US economy, lower international oil prices and the quantitative easing announced by the ECB. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 5,0 per cent in the third quarter of 2014, the fastest quarterly growth since 2003. The unemployment rate continued to decline as job creation accelerated, and lower oil prices have provided a boost to consumption expenditure. Growth in the UK also remains robust, despite slower fourth quarter growth. By contrast, growth prospects in a number of other advanced economies have deteriorated, with Japan in a technical recession and the Eurozone remaining weak amid fears of deflation. Lower oil and other commodity prices have had divergent implications for growth forecasts of different emerging market economies. Deteriorating prospects in some emerging markets contributed to the lowering of the IMF's 2015 global growth 4. Deteriorating prospects in some emerging markets contributed to the lowering of the IMF's 2015 global growth 4 forecast by 0,3 percentage points to 3,5 per cent, with notable downward revisions to Brazil. China. Mexico. Nigeria, and Russia. Growth in China is now expected to moderate to 6,8 per cent from 7,4 per cent in 2014 as the economy continues to rebalance towards domestic consumption and reduce vulnerabilities in its banking system. Although Africa remains one of the high-growth regions, weaker commodity prices pose a risk to the outlook. The impact of lower oil prices on global inflation is expected to influence monetary policy responses. Although the US Fed has indicated that policy rates are still likely to rise from around the middle of the year, recent market expectations are pricing in a later start, as inflation remains low. Furthermore. Fed guidance suggests that normalisation, when it does begin, is likely to be at a gradual pace. Whereas the UK had been expected to be the first of the advanced economies to begin raising policy rates in the first half of this year, the lower expected inflation trajectory has changed expectations to later in 2015 or early 2016. While the UK and US contemplate monetary tightening, the ECB has embarked on open-ended quantitative easing, amid risks of deflation, and the slowdown in Japan is also expected to result in a resumption of asset purchases. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, monetary policy rates have been lowered in Canada. China. Denmark. Egypt. India. Norway. Switzerland and Turkey, while policy has been tightened in Brazil. Nigeria, and Russia. Global foreign exchange market volatility increased in recent weeks in anticipation of quantitative easing by the ECB; possible risks to the euro from the Greek elections; 5. Global foreign exchange market volatility increased in recent weeks in anticipation of quantitative easing by the ECB; possible risks to the euro from the Greek elections; 5 the ending of the Swiss franc floor against the euro; and changing expectations regarding the timing and pace of US policy normalisation. Since the previous MPC meeting, the euro depreciated by about 10 per cent against the US dollar. Over the same period, the rand depreciated by 5 per cent against the US dollar and by 1,5 per cent against the pound sterling, but appreciated by about 6 per cent against the euro. Given the relatively high weight of the euro in the trade-weighted index, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand depreciated by 0,6 per cent. Market perceptions of a possible delay in US normalisation, coupled with the ECB action, has changed global market risk sentiment and improved the near-term prospects for capital flows to emerging markets. This follows a generalised sell-off in December. These flows are likely to be highly volatile and expected to be more discriminating than in the past. The spill-over effects of the ECB quantitative easing on the rand are therefore not expected to be as pronounced as was the case with the US quantitative easing. Capital flows to South Africa have been in line with these global developments. During December, non-resident net sales of bonds and equities amounted to R17,9 billion and R8,2 billion respectively. This trend reversed in late December, as portfolio flows to emerging markets resumed, and in the first three weeks of January, non-residents were net purchasers of bonds to the value of R5,8 billion, while net equity sales amounted to R1,5 billion. The rand has also been affected by domestic factors, including the disappointing domestic growth and current account deficit outcomes, as well as a resumption of 6. The rand has also been affected by domestic factors, including the disappointing domestic growth and current account deficit outcomes, as well as a resumption of 6 load shedding by Eskom. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to developments on the current account of the balance of payments, which measured 6,0 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of 2014. Non-oil commodity prices have been on a declining trend since around 2011, so the recent decline in the oil price represents a positive terms of trade shock that could have a favourable impact on the current account. However, this effect is expected to be limited, in part due to the possible constraining effects of load-shedding on exports. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued. Despite an expected growth acceleration in the fourth quarter of 2014 following an annualised growth rate of 1,4 per cent in the previous quarter, growth for 2014 is expected to average 1,4 per cent, with at least one percentage point lost to work stoppages. The Bank's forecast for growth in 2015 has been revised down from 2,5 per cent to 2,2 per cent, and that for 2016 from 2,9 per cent to 2,4 per cent. This forecast attempts to take account of electricity supply disruptions which more than offset the positive growth impact of lower oil prices. The Bank's composite business cycle indicator has followed a moderate downward trend in the past months, confirming the subdued outlook. More positively, the RMB/BER business confidence index returned to net positive levels for the first time since the first quarter of 2013, when it increased by 5 points to 51 index points in the fourth quarter of 2014. The mining sector, which expanded output by 6,2 per cent on a three-month-to- three-month basis in November, is expected to contribute positively to fourth quarter growth, despite the 1,2 per cent month-to-month contraction in that month. Nevertheless, platinum output still remains below pre-strike levels, and the sector is 7. Nevertheless, platinum output still remains below pre-strike levels, and the sector is 7 likely to face headwinds in 2015 from lower commodity prices and electricity supply uncertainty. The outlook for the manufacturing sector, which contracted for three consecutive quarters, is looking more positive following the resolution of the strikes in the sector, with a three-month-to-three-month increase in November of 4,1 per cent. However, output declined by 2,1 per cent on an month-to-month basis due to electricity supply disruptions. The Kagiso PMI declined to 50,2 index points in December from 53,3 points in November, indicating an expectation of positive, but subdued growth in the sector. Although gross fixed capital formation was the largest contributor to GDP growth in the third quarter of 2014, the trend remains weak. Growth in gross fixed capital formation measured 2,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2014 following two consecutive quarters of contraction. While the private sector investment reversed its negative trend in the previous two quarters, at 0,7 per cent it remains extremely low. The weak growth and investment trends are reflected in the slow rate of formal sector employment creation. According to the Quarterly Employment Survey of Statistics South Africa, employment levels decreased by 5,9 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2014, mainly due to the termination of temporary employment contracts related to the general elections in the second quarter. This contributed to the annualised 20,8 per cent decline in public sector employment, while private sector employment over the quarter increased by 0,1 per cent or 2,000 jobs. Compared with a year ago, employment increased by 1,0 per cent, predominantly in the public sector. 8 Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households remains weak, despite a slight acceleration in the third quarter of 2014 to 1,3 per cent from 1,1 per cent in the previous quarter. However, expenditure on durable goods increased at an annualised rate of 6,2 per cent, and reflected in stronger new vehicle sales. Retail trade sales improved in November with a month-to-month increase of 1,5 per cent, and year-on-year by 2,6 per cent. Consumption expenditure is expected to get some boost from lower petrol prices. Consumer confidence, while still relatively low, also showed a slight improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014, having increased to a level of zero from the previous level of -1. Trends in bank credit extension to the private sector continue to reflect tight conditions for households while credit to the corporate sector remains buoyant. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,7 per cent in November. However, growth in loans to households, which has been steadily declining over the year, reached a low of 3,6 per cent in November, while that to the corporate sector recorded 15,2 per cent. Growth in general loans to the private sector, mainly unsecured lending, remains weak, despite an increase to 2,9 per cent in November; growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance moderated further to 6,1 per cent; while mortgage advances continued to grow below 3 per cent in line with the subdued housing market. These trends are assessed to be a reflection of both continued tight credit conditions and weak demand, as household indebtedness remains high. Wage settlements indicate a continuation of above-inflation wage and salary increases. According to Stats SA data, nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector increased at a year-on-year rate of 6,9 per cent in the 9. According to Stats SA data, nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector increased at a year-on-year rate of 6,9 per cent in the 9 third quarter of 2014. With labour productivity growth of 0,3 per cent, growth in nominal unit labour costs amounted to 6,7 per cent in the quarter. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications the average settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 8,1 per cent in 2014, compared with 7,9 per cent in 2013. The outcome of the public sector wage settlement, due to be implemented in April, is expected to have an important bearing on the general trend of wage settlements in the economy in 2015. Food prices remain a major source of inflation pressure with increases still in excess of the headline inflation rates. However, the moderation observed in recent months is expected to continue, despite the reversal of the downward trend in manufactured food prices at the producer level since October. Agricultural food price inflation remains low, having measured 1,4 per cent in December, with a bumper maize crop expected this year. Global food prices have continued to decline, with the Food and Agricultural Organisation food price index declining by 3,7 per cent in 2014. The inflation landscape has changed significantly in recent weeks, but the outlook for international oil prices is highly uncertain. Unless a persistent oil price decline is assumed, the impact on the inflation trajectory will dissipate over time. The key issue for the MPC is the extent to which second round effects become evident and lead to a more generalised inflation moderation over the forecast period, and to a further and sustained decline in inflation expectations. The forecast of core inflation at this stage indicates a relatively muted decline in underlying inflation. The rand exchange rate against the US dollar remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook and is vulnerable to the timing and pace of US policy normalisation, despite the partial offset from a weaker euro. Further depreciation of the rand against the US 10. Further depreciation of the rand against the US 10 dollar could also erode the positive benefits of lower oil prices on inflation. The slow pace of contraction of the current account will continue to keep the rand sensitive to both domestic and external factors. Along with the exchange rate, wage and salary increases in excess of inflation and productivity growth remain an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Unless nominal wage increases moderate in the lower inflation environment, the beneficial effects of the depreciated currency on competitiveness will be eroded. The MPC views the overall risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less balanced, with no evidence of excess demand pressures on inflation. Notwithstanding a downward revision to the growth forecast, the risks are assessed to be moderately on the downside. This is due to the likely protracted nature of the electricity supply constraints, and their consequences for domestic output as well as for business and consumer confidence. However, given the supply side nature of this constraint, the impact of further monetary policy accommodation on growth is likely to be limited, in the absence of progress being made in the alleviation of electricity constraints. In addition, the implementation of structural reforms is necessary to raise potential growth. For some time we have emphasised that we are in a process of interest rate normalisation. The lower inflation path gives us some room to pause in this process, particularly against the backdrop of continued weakness in the economy. The MPC has therefore unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,75 per cent per annum. 11 The MPC is aware that the moderation in inflation could raise expectations of lower interest rates. The MPC is of the view that the bar for further accommodation remains high and would require a sustained decline in the inflation rate and inflation expectations.

Russia,2015-01-30,"On 30 January 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reducethe key rate from 17.00 to 15.00 percent per annum due to the shift in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth and cooling economy. The decision to dramatically raise the key rate taken by the Bank of Russia on 15 December 2014 resulted in stabilisation of inflation and depreciation expectations to the extent the Bank of Russia expected. The current surge of inflation is driven by the accelerated price adjustment to the ruble depreciation being time-limited. Further the inflation pressure will be contained by decrease of economic activity. According to Bank of Russia forecast, consumer price growth will be lower than 10% in January 2016. According to the results of the year 2014, inflation totaled 11.4% while core inflation was 11.2%. Meanwhile, in December 2014, monthly consumer price growth was 2.6% amid considerable ruble depreciation, growing inflation expectations and increased consumer demand for non-food items. As of 26 January, annual consumer price growth rate was 13.1%. According to Bank of Russia estimates, monthly consumer price growth will moderate slightly in January 2015, but annual inflation will continue the upward trend with a peak in the Q2 of 2015. Current monetary conditions set the ground for inflation decline in the medium run. Annual money supply (M2) growth rate decreased considerably. Significant growth of interest rates on household deposits will stimulate the propensity to save and increase the attractiveness of deposits. Given lending rates hike and tighter borrower and collateral requirements, lending growth (adjusted for currency revaluation) slowed down. Certain increase of economic activity in December 2014 was driven by temporal factors, including growing demand for durable goods amid higher inflation expectations on the back of more rapid exchange rate pass-through. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the annual real GDP growth rate for the year 2014 will amount to 0.6%. Further substantial decrease of output is expected amid the deterioration of external conditions resulting from oil price drop and foreign financial markets inaccessibility for Russian borrowers. Amid the increase in prices for the imported investment goods, deterioration in financial performance of companies, persistently limited access to long-term financing, and tighter lending conditions, fixed capital investments will continue to contract. Real wage decrease and a slowdown in retail lending growth will result in lower consumer demand. The negative impact of deteriorated external conditions will be only partially mitigated by the exchange rate dynamics. According to Bank of Russia estimates, annual GDP growth will amount to (-3.2%) in the first half of 2015. The ruble depreciation will further affect the prices of goods and services contributing to the likely increase in annual inflation in the next months. Nevertheless, inflation and inflation expectations are forecasted to decrease as the economy gradually adjusts to changing external conditions and the impact of the exchange rate dynamics on prices exhausts. Slowdown in consumer price growth will be facilitated by subdued aggregate demand with total goods and services output remaining below the potential as well as by slightly tight fiscal policy. Inflation is expected to be lower than 10% in January 2016. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for13 March 2015. The press-release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

India,2015-02-03,"Sixth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Part A: Monetary Policy Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.75 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 22.0 per cent to 21.5 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning February 7, 2015; replace the export credit refinance (ECR) facility with the provision of system level liquidity with effect from February 7, 2015; continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos of 0.25 per cent of bank-wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate term repo and reverse repo auctions to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.75 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of December 2014, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecasts for growth in 2015 and 2016 downwards. However, these forecasts are higher than the estimates for 2014. In the United States, growth moderated towards the end of 2014, with the boost to consumption demand from the fall in crude prices more than offset by the drag on net exports from a strong US dollar. In the Euro area, economic conditions have deteriorated in an environment of deflationary pressures, political tensions in Greece and still-elevated levels of unemployment. Demand in Japan is only just beginning to recover from the impact of the consumption tax increase last year, notwithstanding massive monetary and fiscal accommodation. The yen's depreciation, however, is helping support exports. In China, growth is slowing because of a weakening property market and excess capacity in several industries. This has prompted targeted measures to ease financial constraints faced by corporations and banks. In other2 emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has weakened sharply for oil exporters, whereas inflationary pressures, subdued investment appetite and a neutral fiscal stance continue to dampen growth in non-oil exporters. The announcement of massive quantitative easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) in late January has reinvigorated financial risk taking, boosting stock markets across the world, even though many market participants have read the softness in crude prices and the ECB's announcement as signifying a weaker global economic outlook. Along with the growing belief that the US Fed will stay on hold longer than previously thought, bond yields in advanced economies (AEs) have fallen to historic lows. Financial markets remain vulnerable to uncertainty surrounding monetary policy normalization in AEs as well as possibly weaker growth in China and oil exporting EMEs. The revision in the base year for GDP and GDP calculation methods will mean some revision in GDP growth numbers for 2014-15 as well as in GDP forecasts. Domestic activity is likely to have remained subdued in Q3 of 2014-15, mainly reflecting the shortfall in the kharif harvest relative to a year ago. Agricultural growth is likely to pick up in Q4 with the late improvement in the north-east monsoon and in rabi sowing. Nevertheless, growth expectations should be tempered as lead indicators such as tractor and motorcycle sales and slowing rural wage growth all point to subdued rural demand. The improvement in industrial activity in November 2014 was broad-based, but continuing contraction in consumer goods production underscores the persisting weakness in consumption demand (even while raising questions about measurement of production). Advance indicators of industrial activity - indirect tax collections; non- oil non-gold import growth; expansion in order books; and new business reported in purchasing managers surveys - point to a modest improvement in the months ahead. Policy initiatives in land acquisition, as well as efforts underway to unlock mining activity and to widen the space for foreign direct investment in defence, insurance and railways, should create a more conducive setting for industrial revival. Faster clearances are also helping in resuscitating stalled projects. The improvement in business confidence is visible in a pick-up in new investment intentions, especially in transportation, power and manufacturing. In the services sector, the purchasing managers' survey indicates slower activity, especially in new orders. However, other indicators of the services sector including foreign tourist arrivals, automobile sales, cargo handled at ports, and railway freight traffic suggest improvement. Overall, growth prospects will be contingent upon a turnaround in investment and a durable improvement in the business climate to complement the upsurge in business optimism. The sharp reduction in oil prices as well as in inflation is likely to increase personal disposable incomes and improve domestic demand conditions in the year ahead. Retail inflation, measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI), edged up in December on the expected reversal of favourable base effects that had tempered upside pressures since June. A slight softening of cereal prices and a sharp seasonal fall in vegetables prices moderated the trajectory of headline inflation, despite persistent firmness in the prices of protein-rich items such as milk, meat and pulses. However, seasonal increases in vegetable prices, which typically set in around March, have to be monitored carefully. In the fuel category, prices of constituents such as electricity, coal and cooking gas remained stable in the absence of administered revisions. Consequently, the CPI registered a monthly decline for the first time since February 2014. Inflation excluding food and fuel declined for the second consecutive month in December. This was largely on account of the declining prices of transport and communication since August, reflecting the impact of plummeting international crude3 oil prices; and softer commodity prices more generally. Inflation in respect of miscellaneous services and housing, however, declined more moderately. Weak domestic demand has restrained corporates' pricing power and inflationary pressures in the non-food non-fuel category. Near-term as well as longer-term inflation expectations of households dropped to single digits for the first time in 21 quarters. Benign expectations are also mirrored in surveys of professional forecasters and industry conducted periodically by the Reserve Bank. Active liquidity management operations under the revised framework adopted in early September have ensured that liquidity conditions have generally remained comfortable. Money market rates have evolved in close alignment with the policy repo rate, excluding occasional pressures around days of advance tax outflows and quarter-end tightness. Overnight variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions announced early in the day give markets advance intimation of the Reserve Bank's assessment on system-wide liquidity needs for the day, allowing fine tuning of liquidity. This also reduces the need for other sector specific windows. The average daily net borrowings under the LAF (including term repos, reverse repos and MSF) have been around 850 billion in December and January. Easing inflationary pressures strengthened the impact of comfortable liquidity conditions on market interest rates; sovereign and corporate bond yields declined by 50 basis points and more in Q3. However, despite a generalised fall in the cost of funds, banks have yet to pass through these effects, as also the effects of the policy rate cut on January 15, into the spectrum of lending rates. With the slump in international crude prices taking its toll on exports of petroleum products, and non-oil export growth also decelerating sharply, merchandise exports shrank in Q3 of 2014-15 after two consecutive quarters of growth. Export performance has been hamstrung by weak global demand conditions and the persisting fall in unit value realisations. The real appreciation of the rupee may also have had some effect. The fall in international crude prices translated into a sizable saving on account of POL imports, despite a pick-up in import volumes in Q3. Gold imports also moderated, coming off the seasonal cum pent-up demand spurt in September-November. On the other hand, non-oil non-gold import growth remained firm and in positive territory, extending a run that began in May. Although overall imports declined in December, they recorded an expansion for Q3 as a whole on the back of the earlier rise in gold and non-oil non-gold items. As a consequence, the trade deficit widened in Q3 relative to the preceding quarter. The estimate of the current account deficit (CAD) for 2014-15 is currently placed at 1.3 per cent of GDP, significantly lower than earlier projections. The CAD has been comfortably financed by net capital inflows, mainly in the form of buoyant portfolio flows but also supported by foreign direct investment inflows and external commercial borrowings. Accordingly, there was accretion to India's foreign exchange reserves to the tune of USD 6.8 billion in Q3. Policy Stance and Rationale 12. By and large, inflation dynamics have so far been consistent with the assessment of the balance of risks by the Reserve Bank's bi-monthly monetary policy statements, although with some undershooting relative to the projected path of disinflation. While inflation declined faster than expected due to favourable base effects during June- November, the upturn in December turned out to be muted relative to projections. Augmenting these data with survey data on falling inflationary expectations as well as data on weak commodity prices and muted rural wage growth, the Reserve Bank projected that it would meet its objective of 6 per cent CPI inflation by January 2016. Having committed in public statements to initiate a change in the monetary policy stance as soon as incoming data permitted, the Reserve Bank cut the policy rate on January 15, 2015.4 13. The Reserve Bank also indicated that “key to further easing are data that confirm continuing disinflationary pressures. Also critical would be sustained high quality fiscal consolidation…”. Given that there have been no substantial new developments on the disinflationary process or on the fiscal outlook since January 15, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to await them and maintain the current interest rate stance. The upside risks to inflation stem from the unlikely possibility of significant fiscal slippage, uncertainty on the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon during 2015 as also the low probability but highly influential risks of reversal of international crude prices due to geo-political events. Heightened volatility in global financial markets, including through the exchange rate channel, also constitute a significant risk to the inflation assessment. Looking ahead, inflation is likely to be around the target level of 6 per cent by January 2016 (Chart 1). As regards the path of inflation in 2015-16, the Reserve Bank will keenly monitor the revision in the CPI, which will rebase the index to 2012 and incorporate a more representative consumption basket along with methodological improvements. The outlook for growth has improved modestly on the back of disinflation, real income gains from decline in oil prices, easier financing conditions and some progress on stalled projects. These conditions should augur well for a reinvigoration of private consumption demand, but the overall impact on growth could be partly offset by the weaker global growth outlook and short-run fiscal drag due to likely compression in plan expenditure in order to meet consolidation targets set for the year. Accordingly, the baseline projection for growth using the old GDP base has been retained at 5.5 per cent for 2014-15. For 2015-16, projections are inherently contingent upon the outlook for the south-west monsoon and the balance of risks around the global outlook. Domestically, conditions for growth are slowly improving with easing input cost pressures, supportive monetary conditions and recent measures relating to project approvals, land acquisition, mining, and infrastructure. Accordingly, the central estimate for real GDP growth in 2015-16 is expected to rise to 6.5 per cent with risks broadly balanced at this point (Chart 2). The revised GDP statistics (base 2011-12) released on January 30 along with advance estimates for 2014-15 expected on February 9, 2015 will need to be carefully analysed and could result in revisions to the Reserve Bank's growth projections for 2015-16.5 16. With liquidity conditions remaining comfortable, the recourse to export credit has been low – less than 50 per cent of the limit on monthly average basis since October 2014. In pursuance of the Dr.Urjit R. Patel Committee's recommendation to move away from sector-specific refinance, the ECR limit has been gradually lowered since June 2014. Continuing with this rationalisation, it has been decided to merge the facility with system level liquidity provision with effect from February 7, 2015. The Reserve Bank would continue to meet system wide liquidity needs as per the revised liquidity adjustment framework announced on August 22, 2014. In order to create space for banks to expand credit, the SLR is being reduced from 22.0 per cent of NDTL to 21.5 per cent. Banks should use this headroom to increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms so as to support investment and growth. Part B: Developmental and Regulatory Measures 18. Developmental and regulatory measures are put in place by the Reserve Bank periodically within the organising framework of the five-pillar approach announced in October 2013 in the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14. The measures set out in this part of the statement emphasise broadening and deepening financial markets; fortifying banking structure; and dealing with stress in banking assets by putting projects back on track. Financial Markets 19. The Reserve Bank reduced the eligibility limit for foreign exchange remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) to USD 75,000 in 2013 as a macro- prudential measure. With stability in the foreign exchange market, this limit was enhanced to USD 125,000 in June 2014 without end-use restrictions, except for prohibited foreign exchange transactions such as margin trading, lotteries and the like. On a review of the external sector outlook and as a further exercise in macro-prudential management, it has been decided to enhance the limit under the LRS to USD 250,000 per person per year. Furthermore, in order to ensure ease of transactions, it has also been decided in consultation with the Government that all the facilities for release of exchange/ remittances for current account transactions available to resident individuals under Schedule III to Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) Rules 2000, as amended from time to time, shall also be subsumed under this limit.6 20. With a view to meeting the emerging needs of foreign direct investment in various sectors with different financing needs and varying risk perceptions as also to offer the investor some protection against downside risks, it has been decided in consultation with the Government of India to introduce greater flexibility in the pricing of instruments/securities, including an assured return at an appropriate discount over the sovereign yield curve through an embedded optionality clause or in any other manner. Guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. The investment limit in Government securities by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is currently capped at USD 30 billion of which USD 5 billion is reserved for long term investors. The limit on investment in Government securities is now fully utilised. As a measure to incentivise long term investors, it has been decided in consultation with Government to enable reinvestment of coupons in Government securities even when the existing limits are fully utilised. FPIs are currently permitted to invest in Government securities with a minimum residual maturity of three years. No such condition has been stipulated for their investments in corporate bonds. To harmonize requirements, it is decided in consultation with Government that all future investment by FPIs in the debt market in India will be required to be made with a minimum residual maturity of three years. Accordingly, all future investments within the limit for investment in corporate bonds, including the limits vacated when the current investment by an FPI runs off either through sale or redemption, shall be required to be made in corporate bonds with a minimum residual maturity of three years. Furthermore. FPIs will not be allowed to invest incrementally in short maturity liquid/money market mutual fund schemes. There will, however, be no lock-in period and FPIs shall be free to sell the securities (including those that are presently held with less than three years residual maturity) to domestic investors. Detailed operational guidelines will be issued by end-February 2015. In the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2014-15, the Reserve Bank announced the implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on Financial Benchmarks (Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar). The Bank has issued guidelines on the governance framework for benchmark submitters on April 16, 2014. The Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) and Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI) have since issued the Code of Conduct for benchmark submitters. An independent company named ‘‘Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd”, jointly floated by FIMMDA. FEDAI and Indian Banks' Association (IBA) for administration of the rupee interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks, has been incorporated. As a further step towards strengthening the benchmark-setting methodology, it has been decided to work out the necessary infrastructural and transitional arrangements for shifting the overnight Mumbai Inter-Bank Offer Rate (MIBOR) from the existing polling based system to transaction based system of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. In order to develop the money and Government securities markets, cash settled 10-year interest rate futures (IRF) contracts were permitted to be introduced by stock exchanges in December 2013. A cash settled IRF contract on 10-Year Government of India (GoI) Security was launched in January 2014 and has received an encouraging response. In order to provide market participants with greater flexibility to hedge their interest rate risk, it has been decided to permit stock exchanges to introduce cash settled IRF contracts on 5-7-Year and 13-15 year Government of India Securities. Detailed operational guidelines will be issued by end-March 2015. In June 2014. FPIs were permitted to participate in the exchange traded currency derivatives (ETCD) market. Simultaneously, the regulatory regime for participation of domestic entities in the ETCD market was modified with the objective of bringing about parity between the ETCD and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. With a view to providing7 greater flexibility to both FPIs and domestic participants in the ETCD market, it has been decided that: domestic entities and FPIs will henceforth be allowed to take foreign currency positions in the USD-INR pair up to USD 15 million per exchange without having to establish the existence of any underlying exposure. In addition, they shall be allowed to take foreign currency positions in EUR-INR. GBP-INR and JPY-INR pairs, all put together up to USD 5 million equivalent per exchange, without having to establish the existence of any underlying exposure. Domestic entities and FPIs who want to take a position exceeding the above limits in the ETCD market will have to establish the existence of an underlying exposure. for domestic participants who are importers of goods and services, the limit up to which they can take appropriate hedging positions in ETCD markets will be determined as 100 per cent of the higher of the average of their last three years' imports turnover or the previous year's turnover, instead of 50 per cent at present. documentation and other administrative requirements for hedging on the ETCD markets are also being rationalised. Restructuring 26. At present, implementation of large projects is complex and unforeseen events may cause delays in project implementation, leading to failure in achieving the originally envisaged date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO). The Reserve Bank has allowed vide circulars dated March 31, 2010 and May 30, 2013, certain flexibility with regard to loans to projects under implementation, wherein DCCO of the projects under implementation along with repayment schedules for such loans are allowed to be shifted to a certain extent without adversely affecting the asset classification of such loans. However, in the case of projects which have been stalled primarily due to inadequacies of the current promoters/management, a change in ownership and management may be required to revive the project. In this context, the new promoters/developers may require additional time to revive/complete the stalled projects. In order to facilitate change in ownership and revival, it has been decided to provide further flexibility by allowing a further extension of the DCCO of such projects where a change of ownership takes place, without adversely affecting the asset classification of loans to such projects, subject to certain conditions. Operating guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. According to Section 19 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, banks are allowed to hold shares in a company, whether as pledgee, mortgagee or absolute owner, up to an amount not exceeding thirty per cent of the paid-up share capital of that company or thirty per cent of their own paid-up share capital and reserves, whichever is less. Banks can also acquire shares of a borrowing company by way of conversion of debt into equity, following prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances by banks and financial institutions, subject to conditions mentioned therein. However, the acquisition of shares of listed companies by conversion of debt or by any other means is required to conform to the Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations and the Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers (SAST) Regulations. Very often, the share prices of companies whose debt is being restructured, in accordance with the stipulations of ICDR Regulations are found to be not in consonance with their intrinsic value. This results in upfront allocation of disproportionate share of loss on restructuring to banks. In view of the above, the Reserve Bank is consulting with the SEBI for waiver, under certain specific circumstances, of the requirement of compliance with the ICDR and SAST Regulations, for conversion of debt into equity. Detailed guidelines will be issued within three months.8 28. Under the Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the economy, banks were allowed in February 2014 to reverse the excess provision on sale of non-performing assets (NPAs) to securitisation companies/reconstruction companies when the cash received (by way of initial sale consideration and/or redemption of security receipts/pass- through certificates) is higher than the net book value (NBV) of the asset, with a view to incentivising banks to recover appropriate value in respect of their NPAs, subject to certain conditions. This dispensation was, however, available on a prospective basis, i.e., only with regard to NPAs sold on or after February 26, 2014. On a review and based on banks' representations in this regard, it has now been decided to extend the above dispensation to NPAs sold prior to February 26, 2014 also. Detailed guidelines to this effect will be issued shortly. Banking and Financial Structure 29. Currently, banks are allowed to offer differential rates of interest on deposits on the basis of tenor for deposits less than one crore and on the basis of quantum for deposits of one crore and above. Banks are, however, not permitted to differentiate on the basis of any other parameter of the deposit contract. Furthermore, all deposits accepted from individuals and Hindu undivided family (HUF) up to one crore are callable i.e., have the facility of premature withdrawal. This results in asset-liability management issues, especially under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement under the Basel III framework. It is, therefore, proposed to allow non-callable deposits. Callability in a deposit will then be a distinguishing feature for offering differential rates on interest on deposits. Detailed guidelines will follow shortly. The final guidelines on payments banks and small finance banks as differentiated banks were placed on the Reserve Bank's website on November 27, 2014 and clarifications on the queries were released on January 1, 2015. The last date of receipt of applications was February 2, 2015. 72 applications for Small Finance Banks and 41 applications for Payments Banks were received up to the deadline for submission yesterday. This number excludes applications that might have been received at other venues. As stated in the guidelines, two External Advisory Committees (EACs) will evaluate the applications received for setting up of small finance and payments banks and thereafter make their recommendations to the Reserve Bank. The EACs for small finance banks and payments banks will be chaired by Smt. Usha Thorat, former Deputy Governor. Reserve Bank of India and Dr.Nachiket Mor. Director. Central Board of the Reserve Bank, respectively. The first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for fiscal year 2015-16 is scheduled on Tuesday. April 7, 2015."
Poland,2015-02-04,"Warsaw, 4 February 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 February 2015 The Council has decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at:  reference rate at 2.00% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 3.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.25% on an annual basis. Global economic activity growth remains moderate, although the situation varies across countries. In the United States GDP growth in 2014 Q4 stayed relatively robust compared to most developed economies, and the economic outlook is still positive. In turn, in the euro area, which is Poland's main trading partner, activity growth has continued to be weak and the incoming information signal a merely slow recovery in the subsequent quarters. Similarly, in the largest emerging economies, including China, economic activity has also remained weak as for these countries, with growth in Russia decreasing close to zero. In the past month, oil prices have fallen again, accompanied by a decline in the prices of some other commodities. Along with moderate global economic growth, this has been pulling down inflation in many countries. In Poland's immediate environment - including the euro area and most of the Central and Eastern European countries - the annual price growth has declined below zero. The fall of commodity prices may support economic growth in countries which are net commodities' importers. Major central banks are keeping their interest rates at a historically low levels. At the same time, the European Central Bank has expanded its asset purchase programme significantly, adding sovereign bonds to the range of instruments targeted. The Swiss National Bank, in turn, unexpectedly abolished the Swiss franc's asymmetric peg to the euro, which resulted in its sharp appreciation vis-a-vis other currencies, including the zloty. The SNB also decreased its policy interest rates. In Poland, preliminary national accounts data for 2014 indicate that GDP growth decreased slightly in 2014 Q4, remaining above 3%. Stable growth in consumption was accompanied by some weakening in investment growth. At the same time, imports growth slowed down more than that of exports, thus reducing the negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth. In December, growth in industrial output, construction and assembly output and retail sales picked up. Bank lending both to households and enterprises continues to rise at a steady rate. At the same time, the sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc has increased the indebtedness of households with liabilities in this currency, which may limit their consumption. Labour market data point to a further decline of unemployment (in seasonally adjusted terms) resulting to a large extent from rising corporate employment. Yet, wage pressure in the corporate sector remains limited, as indicated by continued moderate wage growth. In December. CPI inflation fell to -1.0% y/y, lower than expected. This was accompanied by a further decrease in most core inflation indices, which confirms the absence of demand pressure in the economy. At the same time, the decline in producer prices deepened, pointing in turn to the lack of cost pressure. Inflation expectations of enterprises and households remain very low. Taking into account the recently heightened volatility in the financial markets, the Council has decided to leave the NBP interest rates unchanged. However, the Council does not rule out a monetary policy adjustment in the nearest future, should the expected period of deflation be extended, which would increase the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. A more comprehensive assessment of the outlook for inflation returning to the target will be possible after the Council gets acquainted with the incoming information, including the March NBP projection."
Romania,2015-02-04,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference on 9 February 2015. The analysis of the latest statistical data points to a further decline in the annual inflation rate, which followed a lower-than-forecasted path and ran below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target, due to the steeper drop in volatile prices and to the increasingly weak inflation on external markets, overlapping the lingering negative output gap and the ongoing downward adjustment in inflation expectations. The annual inflation rate fell to 0.83 percent in December 2014, down from 1.26 percent a month earlier. The annual average inflation rate stuck to 1.1 percent in December 2014, while the annual average inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union  came in at 1.4 percent, the same as in the previous month. Looking at the real economy, short-term indicators in October and November 2014 hint at the economy remaining on an upward course during Q4, with both the industrial output volume and the volumes of retail trade and construction works posting positive quarterly changes higher than the Q3 averages. At the same time, the developments in the balance-of-payments current account deficit point to the consolidation of external position sustainability. The real annual growth rate of domestic currency loans gained momentum, thanks to the pass-through of the successive policy rate cuts onto lending rates on new business to companies and households, also fostered by the easing of money market liquidity conditions. As regards the overall volume of credit to the private sector, it was further negatively affected by the sharper contraction in foreign currency credit (stocks) and by the stepped-up operations to remove non-performing loans from credit institutions' balance sheets. All these trends contribute to enhancing monetary policy transmission. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report. Compared to the November 2014 forecast, the new quarterly projection shows a lower expected inflation path. Thus, the annual inflation rate is seen coming in at 2.1 percent at end-2015 and at 2.4 percent at end-2016. The downward shift of the inflation path stems primarily from the anticipated steeper year-on-year drop in volatile prices over the short term, mainly on account of the decline in international oil prices, from the persistence of the negative output gap, the consolidation of inflation expectations at lower levels, as well as from the ongoing subdued inflation and weak economic recovery in the euro area and other European countries. The major risks associated with the current projection relate to the heightened uncertainty surrounding external developments, generated primarily by regional geopolitical tensions, by the situation in Greece and in the euro area, and the growing divergence between the monetary policy stances of major central banks worldwide. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 2.25 percent per annum from 2.50 percent starting 5 February 2015 and to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Moreover, with a view to mitigating interbank money market rate volatility and consolidating the transmission of the policy rate signal, the NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±2.00 percentage points from ±2.25 percentage points. Thus, starting 5 February 2015, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 4.25 percent, while the deposit facility rate will remain at 0.25 percent per annum. The NBR Board has also decided to keep unchanged the current levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on liabilities of credit institutions. Based on currently available data, these decisions are meant to ensure price stability over the medium term, so as to support economic growth, including via the restoration of confidence and the sustainable recovery of lending. The NBR Board reiterates that the consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix and the step-up in structural reforms, along the lines of the external financing arrangements, together with sustainable financial intermediation and an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits are pivotal to consolidating the Romanian economy and enhancing its resilience to external shocks. The NBR is restating that the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools, amid close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, will ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 February 2015, when the calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues for the next 12 months is to be announced.

Czech Republic,2015-02-05,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate to be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016, i.e. over the entire forecast horizon. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to domestic prices and other nominal variables. The forecast expects both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation to be at zero or slightly negative levels in 2015 and then rise to the 2% target in 2016. The Bank Board considers the risks to the new forecast to be balanced, although the degree of uncertainty has increased. In this situation, the Bank Board stated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the second half of 2016. The Czech National Bank stands ready to move the level of the exchange rate commitment if there were to be a long-term increase in deflation pressures capable of causing a slump in domestic demand, renewed risks of deflation in the Czech economy and a systematic decrease in inflation expectations. As regards the assumptions of the forecast regarding the external environment, euro area demand growth should accelerate this year and the next. The decrease in energy commodity prices is reflected in an outlook for continuing subdued growth in industrial producer prices, which will not start rising until the second half of this year. They will increase at a stronger pace in 2016 as the economic recovery gathers pace and the effect of the slump in oil prices dissipates. Euro area consumer price inflation will also rise only slightly from its negative current levels owing to slowly recovering demand. The European Central Bank responded to the subdued inflation by further easing monetary policy. This is reflected in the outlook for foreign interest rates, which is close to zero until the end of 2016, and a weakening of the euro against the dollar. However, the January measures of the European Central Bank have yet to pass through fully to the outlooks for euro area economic activity and inflation, so in this respect the current situation is associated with an increased degree of uncertainty. The price of Brent crude oil has fallen to a very low level and will rise only slightly in the period ahead according to the forecast assumptions. With regard to koruna prices of energy, the low oil price will be partly offset over the entire forecast horizon by a continuing weakening of the euro against the US dollar. Overall, the external environment outlook is having a marked anti-inflationary or even deflationary effect on the forecast for the Czech economy. At the same time, however, the slump in oil prices is a significant pro-growth impulse. Owing to the decline in energy prices and a temporary decrease in food prices, headline inflation will be exceptionally muted this year. As a result of the expected sharp fall in fuel prices and administered prices, which will gradually reflect the fall in energy commodity prices on global markets, inflation will temporarily turn slightly negative in Q3. However, headline inflation will increase next year (which is relevant for the decision-making on the current monetary policy settings) and reach the 2% target in the second half of 2016. This is due to an expected unwinding of the year-on-year fall in energy commodity prices and of the deflationary tendencies in the euro area, combined with a continuing inflationary effect of the domestic economy. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will be somewhat lower than headline inflation until the end of 2015 and will therefore be slightly negative. Core inflation  also called adjusted inflation excluding fuels  will fall temporarily from its current levels exceeding 1%, but will remain positive and start rising again at the end of this year. Together with the unwinding of the fall in fuel prices and food prices, this will contribute to a return of monetary policy-relevant inflation to the 2% target at the end of the monetary policy horizon. Following a temporary slowdown in late 2014 and early 2015. GDP growth will accelerate gradually to 3% in 2016. Domestic economic growth will be boosted by a recovery in external demand, still easy monetary conditions, the positive cost effect of low oil prices and this year also a recovery in government investment. The continuing economic growth will lead to a further improvement in the labour market situation. The number of employees will continue to rise, while the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons will decrease further. Wage growth in the business sector will increase over the next two years and wage growth in the non-business sector will also pick up pace significantly this year. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate to be used as a monetary policy instrument over the entire forecast horizon. The forecasts for headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation are considerably lower than in the previous prediction over the entire forecast horizon owing to the slump in world prices of energy commodities, which is reflected in a lower outlook for domestic administered prices and net inflation. Despite lower external demand. GDP growth has been revised slightly upwards for this year and the next, mainly because of the favourable effect of the significantly lower oil prices. Expected nominal wage growth in the business sector has shifted lower as a result of slower observed wage growth in 2014 and more subdued future inflation. By comparison with the previous forecast, expected domestic interest rates are considerably lower next year, reflecting the extension of the expected use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument in reaction to anti-inflationary pressures from abroad. The Bank Board considers the risks to the new forecast to be balanced. However, a higher degree of uncertainty is associated with the effects of the measures adopted by the European Central Bank on the euro area outlook and also with the future evolution of domestic wages in an environment of very low inflation and a positive cost shock in the shape of the slump in oil prices. The Czech National Bank's analyses confirm that the slump in oil prices is a positive supply shock which will boost Czech economic growth in 2015. In line with its previous communication, the Czech National Bank will not respond to the first-round effects of this shock on the price level. This means it is prepared to tolerate inflation moving temporarily close to, or even slightly below, zero this year. Next year, however, the first-round effects of this shock will unwind, and it remains the Czech National Bank's intention to ensure that inflation returns towards the 2% target. Therefore, it will be important to prevent any second-round effects of the current slump in energy commodity prices, which would be reflected in inflation in the longer run."
Ukraine,2015-02-05,"As part of the run-up to the adoption of the inflation-targeting regime, the Board of the National of Ukraine has adopted a decision to modify the operational framework for monetary policy implementation and enhance monetary policy efficiency and transparency for market participants. The decisions were taken in line with recommendations provided by the Monetary Policy Committee (hereinafter  the Committee) based on the analysis of the outlook for the economy and the money market. making the discount rate more instrumental as the benchmark monetary policy rate. Interest rates on liquidity adjustment instruments will be set in line with the discount rate;. scrapping the practice of holding foreign exchange auctions (effective from February 5, 2015) and setting the indicative hryvnia exchange rate. The hryvnia exchange rate will be set by banks based on the objective parameters of market demand and supply. This will help eliminate uncertainty, enhance the effectiveness of the price-setting mechanism for lending resources and foreign exchange available in the interbank market, and make the monetary instruments used by the National bank more effective. At the same time, with a view to ensuring that the market will follow a projected path and the market situation will be kept under control, the National Bank of Ukraine will tighten the monetary policy stance. To this end, the regulator has adopted a decision (effective from February 6, 2015) to raise the discount rate from 14.0% to 19.5% per annum and adjust interest rates on NBU's liquidity-providing and liquidity-absorbing operations. The main reason behind this decision was stronger inflation risks, which are likely to remain heightened in the near term, reflecting primarily considerable uncertainty over the developments in the east of Ukraine. In December 2014, annual CPI inflation reached 24.9%. The core inflation rate picked up to 22.8%, having accelerated drastically in the past three months. The main factor behind the higher inflation rate was the depreciation of the hryvnia exchange rate as a result of imbalances built up over the past years and worsened expectations amid the social and political turmoil and the military conflict in the east of Ukraine. A rise in administered prices linked to the implementation of much-needed economic reforms was the main contributor to an increase in consumer inflation. A more rigid monetary policy pursued by the National Bank of Ukraine will help stabilize the money market thanks to the greater attractiveness of financial instruments denominated in hryvnia and points to the NBU's resolve to meet its priority goal of achieving and maintaining price stability in Ukraine. The decision to raise interest rates, along with other contingency measures taken by the Government and the National Bank of Ukraine as part of a new program supported by the IMF would help contain inflation rates as early as in the first half of 2015 and pave the way for bringing inflation down to one digit levels in 2016. According to the NBU's forecasts. CPI inflation will stand at 17.2% at the end of 2015. At the same time, higher interest rates will have little impact on business activity in the real economic sector, as bank lending activity remains considerably subdued amid heightened risks in the business environment. A GDP fall estimated by NBU experts at 6.7% in 2014 was of structural nature and was driven by supply-side factors. A negative GDP gap stood at  8  9%, with actual GDP falling below its potential level. According to estimates made by NBU experts, actual GDP could reach potential GDP in the mid-term perspective only if macro-financial stabilization is achieved, with a more rigid monetary policy playing a key role in it. The analysis of the impact of potential risks arising from higher interest rates on the banking system stability has suggested that these potential risks are relatively low compared to the risks of further depreciation of the hryvnia. In addition, higher interest rates across the banking sector have to encourage the return of household deposits to the banking system and reduce inflation pressure. The macro-financial stabilization in the country will also contribute to it. Along with the decision to raise the discount rate, the National Bank of Ukraine intends to strengthen its role as the benchmark monetary policy rate. In particular, interest rates on liquidity adjustment instruments will be set closely in line with the discount rate. This move will ensure the alignment of all the interest rates used by the National Bank. The operational framework of the monetary policy with the discount rate at its core will become simpler and more transparent for market players. The discount rate is the base rate for the National Bank of Ukraine's other rates. The discount rate serves as a benchmark for measuring the value of borrowed funds. By changing the discount rate, the National Bank of Ukraine sends a signal to market participants about the stance of the monetary policy and signals that it is resolute in its efforts to exercise its main function in ensuring the hryvnia stability. The discount rate was last changed on November 12, 2014, when it was set at 14% per annum. The Committee was set up by the National Bank as part of the NBU transformation project in order to strengthen the institutional capacity, streamline the monetary policy decision-making process and enhance public communications about the rationales for these decisions. The Committee is focused on drafting proposals on setting and changing the discount and other interest rates of the NBU; parameters of operations with assets and liabilities for the purpose of banking system liquidity regulation; formulating and implementing the exchange rate policy; determining the amount and procedure of formation of the banks' obligatory reserves; monetary and fiscal policies coordination. The Committee's next meeting has been scheduled for February 25, 2015. Detailed information about the Committee can be found at:."
Georgia,2015-02-11,"11.02.15 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 50 basis points to 4.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 11, 2015 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 4.5%. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the risks affecting the forecast inflation have risen due to external shocks. In order to neutralize the increase in inflation expectations the committee considers gradual exit out of accommodative monetary policy. However, interest rate increase, the monetary policy still accommodative as policy rate remains below the neutral value. According to the current forecasts, unless other shocks affecting the economy will occur, by the end of 2015 the monetary policy rate will be around 5%. According to existing forecasts inflation will remain below its 5% target value in the first half of 2015 and will reach target by the end of the year. Annual inflation in January was 1.4% and this decrease mostly reflects the drop in the fuel prices. At the same time the core inflation increased to 3.2%. The inflation forecasts significantly depend on exogenous factors and contain risks of changing in both directions. The change in the exchange rate is the natural reaction of the economy to the external disbalances and as such serves as a mitigation of the negative impact. The GEL nominal effective exchange rate has not depreciated in annual terms, although GEL did depreciate vs US dollar. Given the high rate of dollarization in Georgia the depreciation vs US dollar creates additional inflation risks as a result of increased inflation expectations and increased intermediate costs related to servicing the USD-denominated loans. Taking into account the existing tendencies MPC deemed monetary policy tightening necessary to reduce the inflation risks. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 25, 2015."
Philippines,2015-02-11,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Latest baseline forecasts show a lower inflation path within the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for both 2015 and 2016, while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored. Inflation pressures have moderated further since the previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting mainly the significant decline in international oil prices. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that prospects for domestic activity continue to be firm, and positive growth dynamics are expected to be supported by buoyant private demand, sustained bank lending growth, and upbeat business sentiment. The Monetary Board also noted that the risks to the baseline inflation forecast remain broadly balanced, with potential price pressures emanating from pending petitions for adjustments in utility rates and possible power shortages. Meanwhile, downside risks could arise from possible slower-than-expected global economic activity. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that the within-target inflation outlook and robust domestic growth support keeping policy settings steady. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor developments affecting the inflation outlook to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with its price and financial stability objectives."
Chile,2015-02-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 February 2015 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, the main news was the announcement of a quantitative easing program in the Eurozone and increased monetary stimulus in several developed economies. With a few exceptions, the prices of commodities rose. Copper is trading at a price similar to that of last month. Global financial conditions for emerging economies posted no noticeable change. The dollar strengthened further. January's inflation was unexpectedly high, primarily the core measure. In the most likely scenario, annual inflation is expected to remain for some months above the upper bound of the tolerance range, and its evolution will be monitored with special attention. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained around 3%. Output and demand indicators suggest that growth rates will be in line with those included in the December Monetary Policy Report. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dropped and nominal wages remained dynamic. Domestic financial conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2015-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2015 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will be converging to the 2.0 percent target in 2015 and takes into account that: economic activity continues showing levels below its potential level; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range, and recent international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as increased volatility in financial markets and foreign exchange markets. Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.17 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 3.22 percent in December to 3.07 percent in January. Inflation without food and energy registered a rate of zero percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation declined from 2.51 percent December to 2.48 percent in January. Recent indicators of economic activity continue showing a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential GDP levels. In February, the BCRP has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 9.0 to 8.5 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.05 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of March will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on March 12, 2015."
South Korea,2015-02-17,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the euro area has also shown signs of improvement, albeit weak, economic growth in emerging market countries including China has slowed. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around major advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, by geopolitical risks, and by the uncertainties over the restructuring of Greek debt. Looking at the Korean economy, while exports have decreased, due mainly to declines in the unit prices for example of petroleum products, the Committee judges that the recovery of domestic demand has not been strong and that the sentiments of economic agents remain weak. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, but that the negative output gap will persist for a considerable time. Despite increases in the extents of decline in petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation registered 0.8% in January, the same as in December, due mainly to an expansion in the scale of increase in prices of industrial products other than petroleum. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose sharply from 1.6% the month before to 2.4% in January. Looking ahead, the Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise from the second half of this year, after remaining at a low level. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices slowed somewhat, while leasehold deposit prices continued their uptrend centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas. In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates, after having fallen in line mainly with monetary policy easing by major countries, have rebounded in response to the improvements in US economic indicators. Stock prices have risen. The Korean won, which had appreciated against the US dollar, has depreciated as the effects of the sustained current account surplus and the dollar's strength globally have intersected. The recent trend of won appreciation against the Japanese yen has meanwhile weakened amid increased demand for safe-haven assets. Bank household lending has sustained its trend of increase at a level greatly exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows."
Israel,2015-02-23,"The CPI declinedby 0.9 percent in January, against the background of a decline in energy prices, a scheduled reduction in water prices, and a relatively sharp decline in the housing component. The rate of inflation as measured over the past 12 months was negative 0.5 percent, as the decline in energy prices had a direct effect of reducing the CPI by 0.7 percent. The one-off reduction in electricity prices is expected to contribute -0.3 percent to the CPI for February. After the January CPI was published, short term inflation expectations from all sources remained below the target range, and there was a slight decline in longer term expectations toward the midpoint of the target range. In the fourth quarter the increase in the employment and labor force participation rates continued, as did the decline in the unemployment rate and the increase in the number of job vacancies. The high rate of growth in the fourth quarter came against the background of the recovery from the effects of Operation Protective Edge, and primarily reflected growth in public consumption, and growth in exports that continued in January as well in view of the cumulative depreciation since August. Tax revenues continued to increase in January, at a rate similar to that of recent months. This month, the shekel continued its appreciation, strengthening by 2.6 percent against the dollar, and by 3.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. After a depreciation of 10.4 percent between August and December in the effective exchange rate, there has been an appreciation of 7.6 percent since December, so that the cumulative depreciation since August has only been 2 percent. Continued appreciation is liable to weigh on growth in the tradable industries: exports and import substitutes. Inflation rates in major markets continue to decline to very low levels, and this month variouscentral banks implemented additional monetary easing measures. In the US, growth was slightly more moderate than expected, and there is uncertainty regarding the date that the federal funds rate will begin to be raised there. In the fourth quarter, there was an increase of 22 percent in housing market transactions, consisting of purchases by young couples and by buyers upgrading their homes, while the number of transactions involving investors remains stable. The moderate decline in the number of new homes for sale continues, and the rate of mortgages being taken out remains high. Corporate bond market spreads increased slightly this month, but they remain low. Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor January declined by 0.9 percent, while forecasters had projected a decline of 0.6 percent, on average. The surprise derived primarily from a relatively sharp decline in the housing component. The reduction in water ratescame into effect in January, and contributed 0.1 percent to the decline in the CPI. Seasonal declines in clothing and footwear prices, and a decline in components affected by fuel prices, also contributed to the decline in the CPI. There were increases in the fruit and vegetables, furniture and household equipment, and health components. Inflation as measured over the preceding 12 months was negative 0.5 percent, compared with an inflation rate of negative 0.2 percent over the 12 months ended in December. The direct effect of the decline in energy prices reduced the CPI measured over the previous 12 months by 0.7 percent, and was the most notable factor in the 2.3 percent decline in tradable goods components of the CPI. CPI components representing nontradable items increased by 0.4 percent during that period, as a result of the increase in the housing component. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: After the January CPI reading was published, the average projection of private forecasters for the next 12 CPI readings increased by 0.2 percentage points, to 0.8 percent. Twelve-month ahead inflation expectations derived fromthe capital market also increased, to 0.7 percent, after the January and February CPI readings exited the calculation range. However, expectations for the coming 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates are 0.25 percent. Medium-term expectations were volatile this month, and are currently about 1.7 percent, and expectations for longer terms declined by about 0.2 percentage points, to slightly above 2.0 percent. Based on the makam and Telbor curves, the probability increased this month that the Bank of Israel interest rate will be reduced in the coming months.However, the average projection of private forecasters does not indicate such a reduction. Real economic activity: Economic activity accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2014, and based on preliminary indicators it is maintaining a high level in the first quarter of 2015 as well. Based on National Accounts data (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms). GDPincreased by 7.2 percent, and business sector product increased by 8.8 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2014, after low rates of growth in the thirdquarter due to Operation Protective Edge. Growth was led by an increase of 12.2 percent in public consumption, an increase of 41.2 percent in durablegoods consumption (due to vehicle purchases being brought forward; privateconsumption excluding durable goods increased 4.4 percent), and an increase of 9.9 percent in exports excluding diamonds and startup companies. Fixedcapital formation increased by 8.7 percent. Goods (excluding diamonds) exports increased by 1.1 percent in January. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.3 percent in January, and was positively impacted onby an increase in revenue of trade and services industries, an increase ingoods exports, and a continued increase in the job vacancy rate. The Purchasing Managers Index increased sharply in January, and for the first time since May 2014 it was above 50 points, the level distinguishing between contraction and expansion of activity. The business sector climate index continues its moderate recovery, indicating a monthly growth rate of 0.22 percent, still lower than the pace in the period preceding Operation Protective Edge. Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and by the Central Bureau of Statistics increased slightly in January. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for the fourth quarter sharpen the picture of recovery in real activity, and among the main working ages (25-64) they indicate improvement in all parameters: the participation rate increased by 0.4 percentage points, to 79.6 percent, and the employment rate increased by 0.7 percentage points, to 75.8 percent.

Health tax receipts continued to increase at a stable rate, and were about 4 percent higher (in nominal terms) in November-January than in the corresponding period one year ago. Budget data: The domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in January was about NIS 5.4 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 4.3 billion in January 2014. Based on trend data, tax revenues increased in January, compared with previous months; compared with January of 2014 it increased by 6.4 percent in real terms (net of one-time revenues). Gross domestic VAT revenues increased by 6.5 percent in real terms, compared with January of 2014. Total domestic expenditure of government ministries in January was about 3.2 percent lower than January 2014. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on January 25, 2015, through February 20, 2015, the shekel strengthened by 2.6 percent against the dollar. The shekel appreciated by about 3.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. After a depreciation of 10.4 percent since August in the effective exchangerate, there has been an effective appreciation of 7.6 percent since December, so that the cumulative depreciation since August has only been 2 percent. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on January 25, 2015, through February 20, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 1.8 percent.Government bond yields increased on the nominal curve, though it was moderate compared with the global trend. The yield on unindexed bonds with 9 years to maturity increased from 1.75 percent to 1.83 percent, and the yield across the unindexed government bond curve was lower than the parallel curvein the US, except for the 30-year term. On the CPI-indexed curve there wasa marked decline in yields. There were slight changes along the Makam yield curve. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained virtually unchanged, at about 77 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in January, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 40.1 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.6 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 8.4 billion (1.0 percent) inDecember, to NIS 816 billion, as a result of net repayment of debt. In January, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 2.1 billion in bonds, slightly lower than the monthly average for 2014 of NIS 2.5 billion. In January, there were net withdrawals from corporate bond mutual funds. Corporate bond market spreads increased slightly from the beginning of February,but they remain at a low level. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 3.2 billion (0.7 percent) in December, to about NIS 438 billion. Ofthat, outstanding housing debt increased by about NIS 2 billion. In January, about NIS 4.6 billion in new mortgages were taken out, compared with a monthly average of about NIS 4.3 billion in 2014. The decline in risk characteristics of new mortgages continues. In January, the interest rate on new CPI-indexed fixed rate mortgages increased by 0.1 percentage points, the rate on CPI-indexed variable rate mortgages increased by 0.2 percent, and therate on the unindexed, variable rate track increased by 0.1 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.9 percent in January, and increased by 2.7 percent in the past 12 months. In November-December, home prices increased by 0.2 percent, and in the 12 months endingin December, they increased by 4.5 percent, compared with 5.9 percent in the 12 months ending in November. There was a turnaround in the number of transactions, with a sharp increase in November and December: the number of transactions increased by 22 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. The increase was mainly among young couples and in purchases from contractors. The trend of moderate decline in the number of new homes for sale continued, but the pace of building starts and building completions remains relatively high. There were 44,000 building starts (housing units), and 44,200 housing units were completed, in the 12 months ending in October. The global economy: Inflation in major economies worldwide continues to decline to very low levels: 1.3 percent in the US (core inflation), -0.6 percent in the eurozone, 0.3 percent in the UK, and 0.8 percent in China. Accommodative monetary policy measures were implemented this month in Australia. Sweden. Denmark. China, and Singapore, and there was an increase in the number of countries with negative interest rates, in response to factors such as low inflation, slowdown in activity, and the desire to avoid the strengthening of the domestic currency. In Europe, there was increased uncertainty this month in view of the negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors, and the possible ramifications, but in recent days, a near-term agreement was apparently reached and the markets do not expect contagion to other countries. The European economygrew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter, with relatively high growth in Germany. Spain and the Netherlands, in contrast with near-zero growth in France and Italy. The weakening of the euro is expected to support future growth. The unemployment rate declined slightly, expectations indices improved, while in contrast, industrial production continued to contract. In the US, there was growth of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter (in annual terms) compared with forecasts of 3 percent, inter alia due to the contraction of public expenditure and the effect of the strengthening dollar on the trade balance. A jump in consumer spending and continued sharp growth in employment with an increase in wages indicate improvement in the state of the US consumer, and the possibility of continued acceleration of growth. In contrast, indicators of companies' situations are less encouraging, against the background of factors such as the strengthening of the dollar, the global slowdown, and the decline in oil prices, whichposes difficulties for companies in the energy industry. The median projection of Federal Open Market Committee members is for an increase in the federal funds rate to 1 percent at the end of the year, though market assessments are for a slower increase. Fourth quarter growth data in Japan and the UK were disappointing. Emerging markets are sensitive to global developments such as the strengthening of the dollar, developments in Europe and the decline in commodities prices. In China, the relative slowdown in the growthrate continues, and negative momentum in Brazil is growing stronger, whilein India a gradual recovery continues. The price of oil increased sharply this month, reaching $60 per barrel, with high volatility, compared to $46.50 per barrel in mid-January. Metals and agricultural commodity indices increased by 2 percent. Most equity market indices worldwide increased this month, as did the yields on government bonds. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for March 2015 by 0.15 percentage points, to 0.10 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflationrate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. Concurrently the Bank hasdecided to narrow the interest rate corridor in the credit window and the commercial bank deposit window from C 2B 10.25 percent to C 2B 10.1 percent. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI declinedby 0.9 percent in January, against the background of a decline in energy prices, a scheduled reduction in water prices, and a relatively sharp decline in the housing component. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that in view of the increased rate of appreciation, and its possible effects on activity and inflation, reducing the interest rate to 0.1 percent is the most appropriate step at this time in order to support achieving the policy targets. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for March 2015 will be published on March 9, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for April 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. March 23, 2015. The main considerations behind the decision.

Hungary,2015-02-24,"At its meeting on 24 February 2015, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 2.10%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pick-up in the components of domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, the unemployment rate continues to exceed its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for January, consumer prices show historically low dynamics. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets, the moderate path of commodity prices and imported inflation, the degree of unused capacity in the economy and the moderation in inflation expectations. The continued decline in oil prices and the fall in market services prices have contributed to the further easing in inflation and core inflation, respectively. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. Based on the low market services price index, the probability of second-round effects may have increased. However, domestic demand-side disinflationary pressures are likely to weaken significantly in the second half of the forecast period as activity gathers pace, and inflation is likely to reach levels around 3 per cent consistent with price stability in the latter half of the forecast period, accompanied by an increase in downside risks. In the Council's judgement, economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. According to the preliminary data release. Hungary's gross domestic product grew in the fourth quarter of 2014 relative to both the same period a year earlier and the previous quarter. Industrial production fell relative to the previous quarter, while the trade surplus remained stable. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable and increased slightly in recent months, with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Looking ahead, domestic demand is likely to be the main engine of growth. The extended Funding for Growth Scheme is likely to promote corporate investment this year, but weak global economic activity and lower receipts of EU funding are likely to work in the opposite direction. Household consumption is also likely to pick up gradually, mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. According to seasonally adjusted data, employment was broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2014 relative to the previous period, with the increase in the number of those employed under public employment programmes also playing a role. International investor sentiment has been volatile since the Council's latest interest rate decision. The political events in Greece and the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia had a negative impact on global sentiment. But the correction in the path of world oil prices since January and the announcement on the extension of the European Central Bank's asset purchase programme at the end of January, and then the results of the negotiations to settle the conflict between Ukraine and Russia resulted in an improvement in financial market sentiment. The forint appreciated against the euro, mainly reflecting international factors. Developments in domestic risk measures were mixed, with the CDS spread falling significantly since the latest policy decision and long-term government bond yields rising slightly. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's view, a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead, therefore, the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish. Based on data available since the latest policy decision, there has been a further shift towards the alternative scenario implying looser monetary policy published in the December 2014 Inflation Report, and the probability of second-round effects taking hold in the wake of disinflationary trends in the economy as well as a change in inflation expectations has increased. However, the Council judges that, based on available information, the current level of the central bank base rate yet remains consistent with the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, achieving the inflation target points in the direction of loose monetary conditions for an extended period. The Monetary Council will consider the need for possible further easing of monetary conditions in view of the March Inflation Report projection, after a comprehensive assessment of the medium-term outlook for inflation."
Turkiye,2015-02-24," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 11.25 percent to 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been reduced from 10.75 percent to 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate has been reduced from 7.5 percent to 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 7.75 percent to 7.5 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 12.75 percent to 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators), and inflation expectations. The Committee anticipates that the core inflation will continue to decline. Yet, a more persistent reduction in inflation necessitates a cautious approach in monetary policy. Taking into account the elevated volatility in food and energy prices, the Committee decided to cut the interest rates at a measured scale. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
India,2015-02-25,"Summary of the Electronic Consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy: January 2015 Electronic consultation with the external Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on monetary policy was held between January 23 and 28, 2015 in the run up to the Sixth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review of 2014-15 on February 3, 2015. The main points are set out below. A Member noted that there was a global disinflationary environment because of weak global growth. Some Members expressed concern regarding the large scale foreign portfolio investment into India and the consequent build-up of short-term debt. They were of the view that European quantitative easing (QE) could further push capital flows to India. Members, however, felt that the Reserve Bank should continue to build reserves. The consequent expansion of domestic liquidity would help in the monetary policy stance as well. They expressed concern that the European QE in conjunction with the likely normalization in the US monetary policy by June may lead to high volatility in financial markets which can spillover to the foreign exchange market in India with consequent volatility in the exchange rate. On the domestic front. Members noted that while there was an improvement in the economic situation with a revival in service sector growth and better corporate results, industrial performance, particularly consumer durables and manufacturing, continued to be weak. Also, service sector growth was expected to slow as the Government cuts plan expenditure to meet fiscal deficit targets. A Member noted that the new GDP series may alter the GDP absolutes as also the growth rates in recent quarters; however, the current indications were that the economy is stagnating. Most Members noted the decline in inflation in recent months at a faster clip than the glide path, driven largely by food and oil prices. While there is uncertainty about oil prices, particularly the growing wedge between prices of global crude and domestic fuel, prices of a number of commodities are expected to remain soft. However, a few Members expressed concern about the stickiness of core inflation. A Member noted that even as the Reserve Bank's survey showed that inflation expectations had softened considerably, further declines may occur at a relatively moderate pace. On the external sector. Members expressed concern regarding continued overvaluation of the rupee, which hurts the financial health of the external sector, besides weakening the competitiveness of the tradable sector, including manufacturing. Members expressed concern on the fall in export growth. A Member said that the longer this overvaluation persists, the greater are the dangers of protectionist actions through trade/industrial policies. Another Member noted that there were no major BoP risks at the current juncture.2 5. On policy action, four of the seven external Members recommended no change in the policy repo rate. The Members opined that there was no noticeable change in the environment since the policy rate action of mid-January 2015. Further action should be only after the Union Budget was presented so that there was clarity on measures proposed to increase potential output and on fiscal consolidation, which would anchor inflation expectations. Of these four Members, one recommended that the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) may be cut by 50 basis points, while another recommended a 100 basis points reduction. Three Members recommended that the policy repo rate be reduced. Two Members suggested a reduction by 25 basis points. According to these Members, the trend reduction in inflation and inflation expectations has been in excess of the glide path. Therefore, a 25 basis points reduction is necessary before pausing to watch food inflation. Also, since lower credit growth was not compensated by increased issuance of commercial paper, it has been suggested that credit is being priced too high in relation to its supply. One Member recommended a sharp reduction of 75 basis points in the policy rate as the economy is stagnating and is in urgent need of a monetary policy push. All the seven external Members  Shri Y.H. Malegam. Dr.Shankar Acharya. Dr.Arvind Virmani. Prof. Indira Rajaraman. Prof. Errol D'Souza. Prof. Ashima Goyal, and Prof. Chetan Ghate  sent their feedback through e-mail. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of discussions of the meetings of TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting."
Egypt,2015-02-26,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 26, 2015 In its meeting held on February 26, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 925 percen. Headline CPI increased by 099 percent (m/m) in January compared to a decline of 007 percent (m/m) in Decembe. The annual rate declined to 966 percent in January from 1013 percent in December, supported by the favorable base effect from last yea. The bulk of the monthly developments came on the back of the administered price adjustments and supply bottlenecks related to the distribution of butane cylinder. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 052 percent in January compared to 03 percent in Decembe. The annual rate continued to ease registering 706 percent in January following 769 percent in Decembe. Upside risks on the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of lower oil prices and the consequent downward revision in international food price forecast. Meanwhile real GDP jumped significantly in 2014/15 Q1, registering at 68 percent the highest annual growth rate since 2007/08 Q4. This comes after the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth rate recorded 22 percen. Notwithstanding the support stemming from the base effect, the expansion in economic activity during 2014/2015 Q1 came on the back of the continuous growth in the manufacturing sector and the expansion of tourism activities after several quarters of contractio. This came despite the continuous weakness in the extraction secto. In the meantime, investment continued to improve for the third consecutive quarte. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

Ukraine,2015-03-03,"On March 2, 2015, to stabilize the macrofinancial situation the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has approved a series of decisions based on the recommendations of the NBU Monetary Policy Committee (hereinafter - MPC) regarding the need to tighten monetary policy. During its meeting, the MPC has considered the monetary market situation, dynamics of macroeconomic indicators and possible scenarios of development. In particular, a significant acceleration of headline inflation has been noted (to 28.5% year-on-year in January 2015). Price adjustment to the hryvnia devaluation was a key driver of the accelerating inflation. In general, the foreign exchange market in Ukraine has been under the stress primarily due to the negative expectations fueled by the military conflict in the East of the country. From the year start, devaluation of UAH/USD exchange rate came to around 80%. Although the Ukrainian economy has faced extraordinary conditions, the said devaluation of hryvnia is considered excessive and inconsistent with the fundamental macroeconomic parameters. The aforementioned has called forth the need to introduce, along with the administrative restrictions already in place, the following comprehensive measures of monetary regulation to curb the devaluation pressure on the hryvnia, lessen the monetary market stress and mitigate risks for price stability in the mid-term:. 1) From March 04, 2015, rise in the policy rate from 19.5% to 30.0% per annum (Resolution No.154 of the NBU Board of March 02, 2015) with the respective adjustment of the interest rates on asset-side and liability-side transactions of the National Bank of Ukraine to regulate the banking system liquidity. At the same time, to avoid adverse effect on the banking system stability it has been considered expedient to limit the policy rate impact on the cost of stabilization loans granted to banks, their cost will remain unchanged. 2) Higher reserve requirements for banks. During the period from March 11 to April 10, the reserve requirements will be increased by approximately UAH 12 bln. which will reduce the spare liquidity in the banking system and will help to curb the devaluation pressure on the exchange rate. The key factor for such increase will be the revaluation of the funds raised in foreign currency. Since the increase in reserve requirements is too tough even for the current situation in the monetary market and it could complicate for banks servicing of the payments operations of their clients, it was decided to allow banks to include 100% of their cash balances in national currency (currently 50% is allowed) in reserves. This will allow to neutralize the impact of exchange rate factor on the required reserve amount to approximately USD 9 billion. Accordingly, the amount of required reserves that banks will have to create, will increase by approximately USD 3 billion (more precise figures will depend on the amount of attracted funds and the exchange rate before the next period). New reserve requirements will enter into force from March 10, 2015. 3) Using hard quantitative indicators of money supply in accordance with the previous agreements with the International Monetary Fund experts. The MPC has also considered and approved the monetary aggregates targets previously agreed with the IMF under New Extended Fund Facility Arrangement. In particular, the maximum monetary base increase in 2015, aligned with the macroeconomic forecasts, was assessed at the level of UAH 91 billion. The monetary program parameters are as follows:. a significant part of increase in the monetary base will be due to provision of credit resources to the Deposit Guarantee Fund for compensation to depositors of liquidated banks in order to restore stability of the banking system;increase of domestic sovereign bonds in the NBU portfolio will be strictly limited, i.e. financial support to Naftogaz and the state budget will be minimized;sterilization instruments will be actively used to absorb excess liquidity in the banking system to level the inflationary and devaluationary pressure;NBU profits will be transferred to the Sate Budget in equal installments and on the quarterly basis to prevent the destabilization of money and foreign exchange markets. According to the National Bank experts, this set of measures, along with the administrative restrictions already in place, de-escalation of military conflict in the East of Ukraine and inflow of funds from the international financial institutions, will relieve stress in the foreign exchange market, reduce exchange rate volatility and create a trend towards one-figure inflation in the midterm. Once these trends will become stable and provided there are signs of macrofinancial stabilization, the National Bank of Ukraine intends to gradually ease the monetary policy and phase out the introduced administrative measures. For referenceThe next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on March 25, 2015."
Poland,2015-03-04,"Warsaw, 4 March 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 March 2015 The Council decided to decrease NBP interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to:  reference rate to 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate to 1.75% on an annual basis. The rise in global economic activity remains moderate, although the situation varies across countries. In the euro area. GDP growth remains low despite a slight acceleration in 2014 Q4. In the United States, economic growth is significantly higher than in the euro area, though it slowed down somewhat in 2014 Q4. In the largest emerging market economies, including China. GDP growth remains low as for these countries, and in Russia it has probably slid below zero. Since the previous Council meeting, oil prices have increased slightly, but remained far lower than in previous years. At the same time, the prices for other commodities, including agricultural products, continued to decrease. The fall in commodity prices amid moderate global economic growth has been adding to a deceleration in price growth in many countries, and has been deepening deflation in most European countries. At the same time, the fall in commodity prices is supporting economic growth in countries that are net commodity importers. Major central banks have kept their interest rates at historical lows. The European Central Bank is starting to purchase government bonds, while the majority of non-euro area central banks have eased their monetary policies, also by lowering interest rates. In Poland, the pace of economic growth in 2014 Q4 slowed down slightly, but stayed close to 3%. GDP growth remained stable due to further rise in consumer demand and still high, despite some deceleration, investment growth. Meanwhile, lending growth was stable and labour market conditions continued to improve. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate has been declining driven to a large extent by rising employment. At the same time, the uncertainty about demand outlook continues to contain economic activity in Poland. Despite improving labour market, wage growth in the economy remains moderate which indicates low wage pressure. Moderate wage growth, the fall in global commodity prices and no demand pressure, all contribute to deepening deflation, both in terms of consumer and producer prices. Inflation expectations of enterprises and households remain very low. The Council became acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on NBP interest rates. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 17 February 2015 (projection cut-off date)  there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of -1.0÷0.0% in 2015 (as compared to 0.4÷1.7% in the November 2014 projection), -0.1÷1.8% in 2016 (as compared with 0.6÷2.3%) and 0.1÷2.2% in 2017. At the same time, the annual GDP growth rate  in line with this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 2.7÷4.2% in 2015 (as compared with 2.0÷3.7% in the November 2014 projection), 2.2÷4.4% in 2016 (as compared with 1.9÷4.2%) and 2.4÷4.6% in 2017. Taking into account prolonging deflation and a significant increase in risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term, as indicated by the March projection, the Council decided to decrease NBP interest rates. Decision to lower the interest rates at the current meeting concludes the monetary easing cycle. The Council adopted Inflation Report  March 2015."
Euroarea,2015-03-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference, here, in Nicosia. I would like to thank Governor Georghadji for her kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to her staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the focus is now on implementation. Following up on our decisions of 22 January 2015, we will, on 9 March 2015, start purchasing euro-denominated public sector securities in the secondary market. We will also continue purchasing asset-backed securities and covered bonds, which we started last year. As previously stated, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector securities will amount to €60 billion. They are intended to be carried out until the end of September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Further information on certain implementation aspects of the public sector purchase programme will be released at 3.30 p.m. We have already seen a significant number of positive effects from these monetary policy decisions. Financial market conditions and the cost of external finance for the private economy have eased further, also following our previous monetary policy measures. In particular, borrowing conditions for firms and households have improved considerably. The substantial additional easing of our monetary policy stance supports and reinforces the emergence of more favourable developments for the euro area economy. In an environment of improving business and consumer sentiment, the transmission of our measures to the real economy will strengthen, contributing to a further improvement in the outlook for economic growth and a reduction in economic slack. Thereby, our measures will contribute to a sustained return of inflation towards a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2014, which was somewhat higher than previously expected. The latest economic data and, particularly, survey evidence available up to February point to some further improvements in economic activity at the beginning of this year. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden and strengthen gradually. The low level of the price of oil should continue to support households' real disposable income and corporate profitability. Domestic demand should also be further supported by our monetary policy measures leading to ongoing improvements in financial conditions, as well as by the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness and from the global recovery. However, the euro area recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in various sectors and the rather slow pace of implementation of structural reforms. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017. Compared with the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 have been revised upwards, reflecting the favourable impact of lower oil prices, the weaker effective exchange rate of the euro and the impact of the ECB's recent monetary policy measures. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside but have diminished following recent monetary policy decisions and the fall in oil prices. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was -0.3 % in February 2015, after -0.6% in January. The negative outcomes largely reflect the impact of the significant fall in oil prices since July 2014. On the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for oil, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain very low or negative in the months ahead. Supported by the favourable impact of our recent monetary policy measures on aggregate demand, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to start increasing gradually later in 2015. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.0% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. In comparison with the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the inflation projection for 2015 has been revised downwards, mainly reflecting the fall in oil prices. In contrast, the inflation projection for 2016 has been revised slightly upwards, also reflecting the expected impact of our recent monetary policy measures. The Governing Council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, geopolitical developments, and exchange rate and energy price developments. When discussing the economic outlook and the new projections, the Governing Council acknowledged that the staff projections are conditional on the full implementation of all our policy measures. Moreover, the March staff projections extend the horizon to 2017. In this context, the Governing Council again stressed that the degree of forecast uncertainty tends to increase with the length of the projection horizon. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the gradual increase in underlying growth in broad money (M3). The annual growth rate of M3 increased to 4.1% in January 2015, up from 3.8% in December 2014. Annual growth in M3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 9.0% in January. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -0.9% in January 2015, after -1.1% in December 2014, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in February 2014. The three-month cumulated net lending flows were positive in January for the second consecutive month, compared with sizeable net redemptions still recorded a year ago. Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued and continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased further to 0.9% in January 2015, after 0.8% in December 2014. Our recent monetary policy measures should support a further improvement in credit flows. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the appropriateness of the Governing Council's recent decisions. The determined implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. Given high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, a cyclical recovery along the lines of the March ECB staff projections is no grounds for complacency. In particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the decisive implementation of product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. It is crucial that structural reforms be implemented swiftly, credibly and effectively, as this will not only increase the future sustainable growth of the euro area but also raise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today, bringing forward the economic recovery. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework. In view of the necessity to step up structural reform efforts in a number of countries, it is also important that the macroeconomic imbalance procedure is implemented effectively in order to address the excessive imbalances as identified in individual Member States."
Malaysia,2015-03-05,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. While the global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, there has been increasing divergence in the growth momentum among the major economies. For most of Asia, growth is supported by the continued expansion of domestic demand. Looking ahead, the global economy is expected to continue on a moderate recovery path. Nevertheless, the downside risks to the global economic outlook remain given the weak growth momentum in a number of major economies. The uncertainties in the policy environment are also contributing to the shift in sentiments in the international financial markets. While the Malaysian financial markets have been affected by these global developments, there remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The banking institutions are also operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers, and continue to provide financing to the economy. There has, therefore, been no disruption to financial intermediation. In the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid a moderation in exports in the fourth quarter of 2014. Going forward, domestic demand will remain as a key driver of growth. While the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the lower earnings in the commodity sector are expected to have some impact on private consumption, household spending will continue to be supported by the steady increase in income and employment. Additionally, the lower fuel prices are contributing to higher disposable income. Investment activity is also expected to remain resilient, with broad-based capital spending by both the private and public sectors, thus cushioning the lower investment in the oil and gas sector. While export growth will be affected by the lower commodity prices, the performance of manufactured exports is expected to improve. The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to still remain on a steady growth path. Headline inflation declined in January and is expected to remain low in the first quarter of 2015. For the rest of the year, headline inflation is expected to trend higher, but to be below its historical average. The lower fuel prices will partially offset other domestic cost factors. While the monthly headline inflation would be subjected to the volatility in global oil prices, underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid the stable domestic demand conditions. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to carefully assess external and domestic developments and their implications on the risks to inflation and on the Malaysian economy. The MPC will also continue to monitor the risks of destabilising financial imbalances to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. Bank Negara Malaysia 05 March 2015."
South Korea,2015-03-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 2.00% to 1.75%. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.00% to 1.75%. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of a solid economic recovery in the US has been sustained and improvements, albeit modest, have also continued in the euro area, economic growth in emerging market countries including China has slowed. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks. Looking at the Korean economy, the Committee notes that exports have decreased, due mostly to declines in the unit prices for example of petroleum products, that domestic demand activities such as private consumption and facilities investment have exhibited sluggish movements, and that the sentiments of economic agents have also not clearly recovered. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, although falling short of the originally forecast growth path. The period of continuation of the negative output gap will as a result also be longer than had been anticipated. Consumer price inflation fell from 0.8% the month before to 0.5% in February, owing mainly to increases in the extents of decline in petroleum product prices and to the slower paces of increase in prices of industrial products other than petroleum. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to 2.3%, from 2.4% in January. Looking ahead, the Committee forecasts that, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices, inflation will continue at a level lower than originally expected. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices accelerated slightly, while leasehold deposit prices continued their uptrend centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas. In the domestic financial markets, after having risen on foreigners' net buying of domestic stocks for example, stock prices have recently fallen under the influence mostly of declines in stock prices in major countries. The Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar, affected by the dollar's strength globally and by the synchronization between movements of the won and the Japanese yen following the yen's weakening, while it has fluctuated within a certain range against the yen. Long- term market interest rates had risen, but have since declined. Bank household lending has sustained its trend of increase at a level greatly exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process, it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows."
Russia,2015-03-13,"On 13 March 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 15.00 to 14.00 percent per annum taking into account that the balance of risks is still shifted towards a more significant cooling of the economy. This decision will contribute to the reduction of these risks without posing an additional threat of increased inflationary pressure. According to Bank of Russia forecast, the current monetary policy and low economic activity will be conducive to the slowing of annual consumer price growth to 9% over the year (March 2016 on March 2015) and to the target of 4% in 2017. As inflation risks abate, the Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate. As of 10 March, annual consumer price growth rate stood at 16.7%. Core inflation increased to 16.8% in February, while monthly consumer price growth declined from 3.9% in January to 2.2% in February. The high level of annual inflation is caused primarily by the supply-side factors, i.e. the ruble depreciation and external trade restrictions. Their impact is short-term and will be exhausted before the end of 2015. At the same time, demand-side inflation factors' dynamics show a pronounced downward trend. A surge in consumer activity at the end of last year was temporary. January 2015 saw a continued fall in real wage growth and a sharp decline in consumer expenditures which exerts a restraining influence on the prices of goods and services. Current monetary conditions will contribute to consumer price growth decline. Annual money supply (M2) growth rate decreased considerably as compared with the beginning of 2014. Given lending rates hike and tighter borrower and collateral requirements, annual lending growth (adjusted for currency revaluation) slowed down. Despite the key rate cut, it remains rather high for the deposit rates to support the public's propensity to save. Structural factors continue to exert a restraining influence on economic growth, however, its slowing is becoming more and more cyclical. Weak economic activity will be conducive to inflation reduction. Further decrease in output is expected amid persistently low oil prices and foreign capital market inaccessibility for Russian borrowers. Fixed capital investments will continue to contract due to high prices for the imported investment goods, deterioration in companies' financial performance, tighter lending conditions, and high economic uncertainty. The labour market will adjust to new conditions largely through real wage decrease and part-time employment, which along with a slowdown in retail lending growth will result in lower consumer demand. The ruble depreciation will partially mitigate the negative impact of changed external conditions, raising the competitiveness of Russian goods and containing imports along with slack domestic demand. As a result, only net exports will make a positive contribution to output growth. According to Bank of Russia estimates. GDP will fall by 3.5-4.0% in 2015. Thus, the current economic situation sets a trend towards inflation reduction. According to Bank of Russia forecasts, monthly consumer price growth will continue slowing down. At the same time, given the short-term factors and due to the low base effect, annual inflation will grow with a peak in the second quarter of 2015. A slowdown in annual consumer price growth will be conducive to inflation expectations decrease. According to Bank of Russia forecast, annual inflation will fall to about 9% over the year and to the target of 4% in 2017. High inflation expectations, review of planned increases in administered prices and tariffs, budget policy easing, and also possible accelerated growth in nominal wages inter alia in the budget sector, are the key risks for inflation dynamics. As the said risks abate, the Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for30 April 2015. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30. Moscow time.

Peru,2015-03-15,"INFORMATIVE NOTE MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2015 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will be converging to the 2.0 percent target in 2015 and takes into account that: economic activity continues showing levels below its potential level; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range, and recent international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as increased volatility in financial markets and foreign exchange markets. Inflation in February showed a rate of 0.30 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 3.07 percent in January to 2.77 percent in February, within the target range. Inflation without food and energy registered a rate of 0.16 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation declined from 2.48 percent January to 2.45 percent in February. Recent indicators of economic activity and consumer and business confidence continue showing a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential GDP levels. In March, the BCRP has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 8.5 to 8.0 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to keep the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.05 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of March will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on April 9, 2015."
Turkiye,2015-03-17," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). Yet, uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitates maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
United States,2015-03-18,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic growth has moderated somewhat. Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate. A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish. Household spending is rising moderately; declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power. Business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow and export growth has weakened. Inflation has declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Consistent with its previous statement, the Committee judges that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC meeting. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. This change in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Jerome H Powell; Daniel K Tarullo; and John C Williams."
Chile,2015-03-19,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 19 March 2015 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). The economic recovery of the developed world, particularly the United States, is running on course, while prospects have deteriorated for the most part of Latin America. During the month, commodity prices dropped although there were some exceptions such as copper. International financial conditions for emerging economies worsened and the dollar strengthened further. Worth noting were the stronger monetary stimuli in several economies and, most recently, the cautious tone of the Federal Reserve's communication. As in the previous month. February's inflation exceeded the market's expectation. Core inflation remains high. In the most likely scenario, annual inflation is forecast to remain above the tolerance range for some months, a development that will continue to be monitored with special attention. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained around 3%. Output and demand indicators point at growth rates in line with those projected in the December Monetary Policy Report. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate increased slightly and nominal wages remained dynamic. Local financial conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Pakistan,2015-03-21,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March 21, 2015 Increasing number of economic indicators in the current fiscal year have moved in favorable direction. Headline CPI inflation continues to follow downward trajectory and is expected to be well below the annual target of. percent; latest SBP projection range is 4-5 percent for average CPI inflation in FY15. At the same time. GDP growth is on course to surpass the FY14 outcome. Owing to recent foreign exchange inflows and lower oil price, external sector outlook continues to improve. Government's efforts to contain the fiscal deficit have been on track in the first half of FY15, despite slightly slower growth in revenue collection. IBA-SBP survey- based indices of March 2015 report increase in consumer confidence and in current economic conditions. The current macroeconomic stabilization has thus opened window of opportunity to gear up reforms to ensure improvements in the economy are sustainable. As per the recent trend, moderation in inflation is broad-based with food and non-food inflations receding, both the measures of core inflation. Non-Food Non-Energy and Trim-Mean, are also recording decline. However due to current decline in inflation in general and commodity prices in particular, there could be an increase in aggregate demand which may have inflationary repercussions beyond FY15. After growing by. percent in Jul-Jan FY15. Large-scale Manufacturing is likely to gain traction due to recent cut in policy rate and low prices of raw materials that could boost the manufacturing sector. In the agriculture sector, improved outcomes in major kharif crops (cotton and rice, in particular) and incentives in place along with favorable weather conditions for rabi season wheat crop. GDP growth is expected to be higher than that of FY14. With strong workers' remittances and declining import growth, current account deficit has shrunk in Jul-Feb period of FY15 as compared to same period last year. The improvement is in spite of subdued exports performance. Nonetheless with lower price impact in imports and multilateral inflows on track, the external sector outlook remains stable. This is most visible in the stability in foreign exchange market and in an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves. During Jul-Feb FY15 period. Net Domestic Assets decreased and Net Foreign Assets increased, which is welcome development in contrast to the trends in the same period last year. The Year-on-Year growth in broad money (M2) by February 27, 2015 was 1. percent; lower than the average growth of 13. percent in the past five years. This deceleration is largely due to contraction in Net Domestic Assets of the banking system. Growth in credit to private sector during Jul-Feb FY15 has also remained subdued at Rs 158. billion compared to Rs 298. billion Page STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN in the same period of FY14. Thus these monetary indicators have largely reflected the underlying trends in falling inflation. The Central Board of Directors has decided to reduce the SBP policy rate by 50 basis points from. percent to. percent effective from 24th March 2015. Page."
Israel,2015-03-23,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor February declined by 0.7 percent, while forecasters had projected a decline of 0.6 percent, on average. The decline in electricity prices, which came into effect in February, contributed 0.3 percentage points toward the CPI decline, and a decline in fuel prices contributed 0.1 percentage pointsto the decline. There was also a further decline in the communication component and a seasonal decline in clothing and footwear prices. The fruit andvegetable component increased by 0.1 percent. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 1 percent, compared with an inflation rate of negative 0.5 percent over the 12 months that ended in January. The direct effect of the decline in energy prices reduced the CPI measured over the previous 12 months by 1.0 percent, and was the most notable factor in the tradable goods components of the CPI declining by 2.7 percent, compared with 2.3 percent for the figure last month.CPI components representing nontradable items remained unchanged over the period, despite the increase in the housing component. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: After the February CPI reading was published, and dropped out of the forecast range, the average projection of private forecasters for the next 12 CPI readings increased by 0.4 percentage points, to 1.2 percent, and expectations for the coming 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates increased by about 0.2 percentage points, to 0.4 percent. Twelve-month ahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market were volatile this month, and are currently at 0.5 percent, and expectations for two years are 0.9 percent. Medium-term expectations declined this month to below 1.5 percent, but expectations for longer terms remained stable around the midpoint of the inflation target range. Most private forecasters do notexpect a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next few months; however, the makam and Telbor curves point to some probability of such a reduction. Real economic activity: Preliminary indicators of activity in the first quarter of 2015 show a mixed picture. Foreign trade data indicate that exports in December-February declined by 3.7 percent compared with the previous three months. However, this figure is in dollar terms, and was negatively impacted by the strengthening of the dollaragainst other currencies. Likewise, exports were affected on a one-time basis in February by work disruptions at Israel Chemicals Ltd. In February, there was a recovery in tourism, but the number of tourist arrivals remains markedly lower than the figure in the corresponding period of the previous year. Partial data from the Companies Survey for the first quarter indicatecontinued growth at a moderate rate in the business sector. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in February, and was positively affected by an increase in building starts, trade industry revenue, and the job vacancy rate. The Purchasing Managers Index declined this month and returned to below 50 points. The business sector climate index continues its moderate recovery, indicating a monthly growth rate of 0.23 percent, still lower than the pace in the period preceding Operation Protective Edge. A similar trend can be seen in Consumer Confidence Indices compiled byBank Hapoalim and by the Central Bureau of Statistics, which increased this month as well. The labor market: The labor market continues to present a positive picture: Labor Force Survey data for January indicate a decline of 0.1 percentage points in the unemployment rate among 25-64 years olds (the main working ages), to 4.8 percent. They also indicate an increase in the participation rate by 0.1 percentage point, to 79.7 percent, and an increase in the employment rate by 0.2 percentage points, to 75.9 percent, with an increase in the share of employed people working full time. Nominal and real wages increased by 0.2 percent in October-December, relative to July-September (seasonally adjusted data). Stable growth continued in health tax receipts, which were about 5.1 percent higher (in nominal terms) in December-February than in the corresponding period one year ago. Job vacancy rate data for February indicate continued labor market expansion. In February, the number of employee posts increased by 0.3 percent: there was an increase of 0.2 percent in the business sector and an increase of 0.4 percent in public services. Budget data: The domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in January-February was about NIS 2.8 billion, compared with a deficit of NIS 2.3 billion in the corresponding period of last year. Based on trend data, tax revenues were essentially unchanged in February, compared with previous months; and compared with February of 2014 it increased by 2.1 percent in real terms (net of one-time revenues). Gross domestic VAT revenues increased by 8.1 percent in real terms, compared with February of 2014. Total domestic expenditure of government ministries in January-February was about 2.5 percent higher, in nominal terms, than in the corresponding period of last year. Staff forecast: This month the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. According to the revised forecast, the inflation rate over the next four quarters will be 1.1 percent; the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected, according to the staff forecast, to remain at 0.1 percent throughout 2015 and tobegin to increase slowly in 2016. GDP is expected to grow in 2015 by 3.2 percent (similar to the previous forecast), and in 2016 it is expected to grow by 3.5 percent (3.0 percent in the previous forecast). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on February 22, 2015, through March 20, 2015, the shekel weakened by 5 percent against the dollar, and strengthened by 1 percent against the euro. The shekel weakened by about 1.9 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on February 22, 2015, through March 20, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 7.1 percent. Government bond yields declined on the nominal curve, similar to the global trend. The yield on unindexed bonds with 9 years to maturity declined from 1.8 percent to 1.5 percent, and the yield across the unindexed government bond curve was lower than the yield on the parallel curve in the US, except for the 30-year term. On the CPI-indexed curve, as well, there was a markeddecline in yields. There were declines along the Makam yield curve,against the background of the interest rate reduction last month, and the 12-month yield is around 0.08 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained virtually unchanged, at about 75 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in January, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 39.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 11.4 percent. In recent months an increase is apparent in current account deposits at the expense of unindexed short-term deposits, and since the reduction in the interest rate for March there has been a large volume of net withdrawals from money market funds. The credit market: In February, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 2.7 billion in bonds, slightly higher than the monthly average for 2014 of NIS 2.5 billion. In February, netwithdrawals from corporate bond mutual funds continued, with a slight decline in spreads. New mortgage volume remained stable at an elevated rate of NIS 4.6 billion in February, compared with a monthly average of about NIS 4.3 billion in 2014. Some of the risk characteristics of new mortgages continue to decline, while others were stable. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) was unchanged in February, and increased by 2.4 percent in the past 12 months. In December-January, home prices increased by 0.8 percent, and in the 12 months ending in January, they increased by 4.5 percent. Following increases in the previous two months, the number of housing transactions declined in January, with an increase in the volume of transactions by investors, and thus in their share oftotal transactions. Data on the supply of homes continue to indicate an elevated level: the pace of new home sales remained high, as did the number of new homes available for sale despite the continued moderate downward trend in that figure. In 2014, there were about 43,600 building starts, and building completions were at a high level of about 44,800. The global economy: Global economic activity continues to expand slowly with a high level of uncertainty. Quantitative easing started in Europe, and led to further weakening of the euro, increases in share prices, and an upward revision of growth and inflation forecasts, though these remained very low. Purchasing managers indices, retail sales figures and the unemployment rate all improved this month. In contrast, despite the agreement achieved between Greece and European Union institutions, there remains a very elevated level of uncertainty regarding developments in Greece and their possible implications. In the US, most data that became available this month, other than labor market data, were negative against the background of the winter weather. The Purchasing Managers Index and the Consumer Confidence Index weakened, and the Federal Reserve's Beige Book noted the negative effect of the strengthening dollar on export-oriented manufacturing and of the decline in oil prices on the energy export sector. The growth in nonfarm payrolls in February was greater than expected, and the decline in the unemployment rate continues. The Fed removed its 'patient' terminology with regard to interest rate increases, but the interest rate path as reflected in the median of FOMC members' predictions was lowered significantly. Core inflation (excludingfood and energy) as measured over the past 12 months remained at 1.6 percent, while the overall CPI declined to negative territory due to declines infuel prices. Stock market prices declined. In Japan, there were mixed datathis month, and the central bank did not change its stimulus program. The economic recovery in the UK continues, but the strengthening of the pound against the euro raises concerns about its continuation. Prices in emerging economy stock markets declined this month, and the uneven trend continues: The slowdown in economic activity in China persists, there is recovery in India, and weakness in Brazil. Many central banks adopted accommodative monetary measures this month as well. After the price of oil increased last month to $60 a barrel, the price declines resumed this month, with the price reaching $53 a barrel. Agricultural commodity prices declined by 4.9 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for April 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of theshekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: v The rate of inflation as measured over the past 12 months was negative 1.0 percent, impacted on bydeclines in prices of fuel, electricity, and water. According to the Research Department's staff forecast, as well as the average projection of private forecasters, inflation is expected to return to within the target range, near its lower bound, in the next 12 months; the projected rate ofinflation based on banks' internal interest rates remains below the target range. Medium-term inflation expectations declined slightly this month, and expectations for longer terms are at the midpoint of the target range. v Indicators of real economic activity show a mixed picture in the first quarter: some weakness in exports is apparent, the Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in February, and preliminary data from the Companies Survey indicate continued growth at the moderate rate that characterized it last year.Labor market indicators point to continued improvement. v From the monetary policy discussion on February 22, 2015, through March 20, 2015, the shekel weakened by 5 percent against the dollar, and strengthened by 1 percent against the euro. The shekel weakened by 1.9 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. For the year to date, there has been an effective appreciation of 2.1 percent in the shekel. v Several additional central banks adopted monetary easing measures this month. The US growth forecast was revised slightly downward, and uncertainty continues regarding the date that the federal funds rate will begin to be raised there. In Europe, an improvement in activity can be seen against the background of the accommodative monetary policy. v Home prices continue toincrease, new mortgage volume remains elevated, and in January there was an increase in investors' share of total transactions. Various indicators point to growth in the supply of homes. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for April 2015 will be published on April 6, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for May 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday,April 27, 2015. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for April 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.

Armenia,2015-03-24,"PRESS RELEASE 24.03.2015 On the March 24 of 2015 Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia decided to lower the Lombard Repo Facility Rate by 1.5 percentage points to 12.0% and leave the Refinancing Rate unchanged, at 10.5%. There was 0.2% of deflation in February of 2015 compared with 1.2% of deflation recorded in the same month last year. The 12-month inflation rate reached 5.4% late in the month. The Board believes that the 12-month inflation in the coming months will hover around the upper bound of the confidence band but will approach the target afterwards. Recent developments in the external sector were mainly in line with forecasts of the Central Bank made at the beginning of the year, in which case economic growths in the U.S.A. Eurozone and Russia are estimated to have been within forecasts. Deflationary trends in international markets of basic commodities and food products persisted, as were expected. Based on these developments, the Board admits that minor deflationary effects from the external sector in the coming months are likely. The Board states that in the period January-February the domestic economic activity somewhat exceeded the expectations largely due to higher than expected growth in the agricultural and construction sectors. On the other hand, determined by the previous year's developments, the tension in the domestic financial and commodity markets has eased. Therefore, the Central Bank considers it reasonable to continue reducing short-term market rates, pushing the Lombard Repo Facility Rate down and helping it uphold an accepted 1.5 percentage point spread from the Refinancing Rate. A zero or weak mechanism of reserve requirement for long-term funds attracted by banks became effective on the 1st of March this year, which, combined with other macro- prudential measures taken on during the first quarter this year, substantially reduced the impact of the reserve requirement ratio which had been tightened in the previous yearend. This, in turn, involves easing of monetary conditions, and will further contribute to the economic revival. Later, as economic developments unfold, the Central Bank will adjust its monetary policy directions, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium-term perspective. Detailed information on the setting of the interest rate will be available in the Press Release (Interest Rate Minutes) due April 3, 2015. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Nigeria,2015-03-24,"Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Communique No. 100 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday 23rd and Tuesday 24th March, 2015 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 23rd and 24th March, 2015, against the backdrop of harsh external economic environment and significant risks in the domestic economy. In attendance were eleven (11) out of the twelve (12) members, including Dr. O. Nnanna who assumed duty as Deputy Governor (Financial System Stability) at the end of January 2015. The Committee analyzed key developments in the global and domestic economic and financial conditions as well as the outlook for the rest of 2015. International Economic Developments The Committee noted that the pace of global economic recovery had remained moderate and uneven. In particular, the Committee noted that lower commodity prices were weighing heavily on output growth, especially in the oil exporting countries. In addition, expectations of a rise in US short-term interest rates continue to fuel capital outflows and currency weaknesses in the emerging markets and developing countries. Against the backdrop of sustained 1 weakness in the Euro zone and softening growth in the emerging markets, global output has remained largely tapered. During the first quarter of 2015, the United States led the global impetus to output growth as consumer demand strengthened on the heels of falling oil prices, lower US oil imports and accommodative monetary policy. In contrast, in the Euro area, continued output decline, in the face of positive oil price shocks, made the European Central Bank (ECB) to introduce a massive €11 trillion asset purchase programme, commencing in March 2015, involving a €60 billion monthly asset purchase. The programme, although open-ended, is expected to last at least until September 2016 by which time inflation may have gained reasonable traction. The Committee, however, noted a number of important downside risks to global outlook in 2015 including geopolitical tensions and conflicts; the negative impact of commodity price declines; weak external demand and the possibility of Monetary Policy normalization in the US. Growth could, however, remain subdued in most of the Euro Area and Japan, in the short-to-medium term. Growth in the emerging markets may exhibit wide variations with sharp deceleration in most of the large emerging market economies, especially in Latin America and Eastern Europe, due to the headwinds from softening commodity prices and slowdown in external demand from the advanced economies. In addition, country specific risks, such as political crisis, structural factors, 2 adverse weather conditions, and large swings in currencies may continue to slow aggregate demand in a number of countries. Global inflation continues to be low due to declining oil prices and continuing slack in global output. Core inflation has continued to sag due amongst other things to the dampening effect of low oil prices and lack of appreciable wage gains. Average inflation for the developed economies is projected to remain flat at 15 per cent in 2015 due to the increasing output gap, weak recovery, and strong regional currencies. This development appears to be offsetting the risk of imported inflation in the emerging and developing countries, most of which have experienced moderate to severe depreciation in their local currencies. Developing economies are thus expected to have moderate inflation in the medium term. The Committee observed that the outlook for global monetary policy suggested a predominantly easy stance. The Euro Area and Japan are expected to remain in the accommodative mode. Even in countries where growth appears to be strengthening like the US. UK and Canada, there are indications of delayed switch to tight monetary policy stance. Owing to currency concerns, however, the Committee further noted that some emerging and developing economies may experience moderate tightening in the short to medium term. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to average 49 per cent in 2015. Domestic Economic and Financial Development Output The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate at 594 per cent in Q4 of 2014 lower than the 677 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2013 and the 623 per cent recorded in Q3 2014. The Committee noted that the slowdown in growth resulted mainly from the non-oil sector, which grew by 644 per cent in Q4, 2014 compared with 878 per cent in Q3 2014. Agriculture industry, construction, trade and services contributed, 089, 130, 364, 087 and 245 percentage points, compared with 121, 104, 036, 108 and 253 percentage points, respectively, in Q3 2014. The softening non-oil GDP was partly traced to the spill over effects of low oil prices which negatively impacted agricultural output, trade and services. Oil-GDP on the other hand, grew by 118 per cent in Q4, 2014 compared with a decline of 360 per cent in the preceding quarter. The growth in oil-GDP is particularly noteworthy because it came at a time when the sector was experiencing external negative price shocks. Prices Headline inflation remained within the 60—90 per cent band established by the CBN. However, the Committee noted with concern, the gradual increase in the year on year headline inflation during the first two months of the year from 80 per cent in December 2014 to 82 per cent in January and further to 84 per cent in February 2015. The underlying inflationary pressures came largely from food (particularly imported food) and the core components. Food inflation rose from 92 per cent in December 2014 to 94 per cent in February 2015 while core inflation increased from 62 to 70 per cent during the same period. The major risks to inflation, the Committee noted, include elevated aggregate spending in the run- up to the 2015 general elections, the likely higher import prices on the strength of an appreciating dollar and possible food supply shocks linked to insurgency and insecurity in some major agricultural zones of the country. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets' Developments Broad money supply (M2) declined by 170 per cent in February 2014 over the level at end-December 2014. This translated to an annualized decline of 1023 per cent compared with the provisional growth benchmark of 1524 for fiscal 2015. The decline in M2 primarily reflected the contraction of 1814 and 822 per cent in net foreign assets (NFA) and other assets (net), respectively, during the period. The fall in NFA is attributed to the combined effects of weakening oil price and reversal of portfolio capital flows. During the period, net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 989 per cent in February 2015, annualized to a growth rate of 5931 per cent, compared with a growth rate 789 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2014 and an indicative benchmark of 293 per cent for 2015. The credit-to-government (net) component grew sharply by 5469 per cent relative to a decline of 2181per cent at end-December 2014. The Committee noted that money market interest rates were relatively volatile in the intervening period but stabilized on average during the first two months of 2015, as banking system liquidity fluctuated. Thus average inter-bank call and OBB rates, which opened at 1058 and 1052 per cent on 5th and 6th January 2015, closed at 1100 and 923 per cent, respectively, on February 27, 2015. Average inter-bank call and OBB rates for the period were 1521 and 1836 per cent, respectively. The Committee observed that the bearish conditions in the capital market continued in the review period. Market capitalization also moved in the same direction, falling by 125 per cent from N1148 trillion to N1004 trillion during the period. The Committee noted that the 6 situation, though reflecting current trends globally, needed to be monitored closely. External Sector Developments Following the closure of the Retail Dutch Auction System (rDAS) window of the foreign exchange market on 18th February 2015, the foreign exchange market is now unified. Consequently the naira exchange rate opened at N1801/US$ and closed at N1980/US$, with a daily average rate of N1980/US$. This represented a depreciation of N179k or 904 per cent for the period. Considerations The Committee expressed satisfaction with the impact of the decisions taken to harmonise the foreign exchange market. As a consequence of those actions, the interbank exchange rate has stabilized after an initial adjustment. The Committee, however, expressed concern about the wide divergence between the interbank and the bureau-de-change exchange rates, which provides an avenue for arbitrage and speculative activities in the market. The Committee noted with concern the phenomenon of currency substitution and partial dollarization in the economy, a development which may have significantly fuelled the high demand for foreign exchange. The Committee, therefore, reiterated that the naira remained the currency of transaction in the economy and 7 advised the Bank to take all possible measures to address this development. The Committee also expressed concern about the outlook for growth, which had moderated partly due to the effects of low oil prices, naira exchange rate depreciation, and election- related concerns. The Committee was however, optimistic that the situation would improve once elections were successfully conducted with the expected improvement in business confidence. The Committee took note that while adverse developments in international oil prices had affected government revenues and reserves accretion and impacted negatively on capital flows, the financial system remained stable with key banking stability indicators showing robustness. In the light of this, the Committee directed the Bank to take all necessary measures to improve the resilience of the financial system as well as the overall economic environment and functioning of the financial markets. The Committee also took note of the administrative measures implemented by the Bank since the last meeting of the MPC to achieve stability in the foreign exchange market. The Bank had on 18th February 2015 taken the bold supply management measures to close the official window of the foreign exchange market in order to create transparency and minimize arbitrage opportunities in the foreign exchange market. Furthermore to deepen the market and enhance the efficacy of the demand management measures, the Bank gave specific directives on the effective monitoring and 8 repatriation of both oil and non-oil export proceeds. In addition, the utilization of export proceeds has been restricted to eligible transactions only, to minimize leakages. The Committee enjoined the Bank to continue to fine-tune demand management measures as well as implement appropriate supply-enhancing strategies to ensure effective demand and utilization of foreign exchange in the country. The Committee noted the gradual rise in headline inflation, driven mainly by exchange rate-induced high prices of imported (processed) food and output supply shocks. However the Committee was of the view that the prevailing tight monetary policy stance and some of the recent administrative measures would among others help to lock-in inflation expectations and further stabilize the naira exchange rate. Decision In the light of the above considerations, the Committee observed that its previous decisions needed time for their effects to fully permeate the economy and therefore, voted to maintain the current position. Consequently the Committee decided as follows: All eleven members unanimously voted to retain the MPR at 13 per cent; retain the CRR on Private Sector deposits at 20 per cent; retain CRR on Public Sector deposits at 75 per cent; and retain the liquidity ratio at 30 per cent. I thank you all for Listening Godwin I Emefiele CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 24th March, 2015 10."
Georgia,2015-03-25,"25.03.15 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 4.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 25, 2015 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4.5 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the risks and expectations affecting the forecast inflation have risen due to external shocks. Despite the appreciation of GEL nominal effective exchange rate, the recent depreciation of GEL vs USD has been reflected in the increase in the intermediate costs related to USD- denominated debt service. Hence certain increase in the inflation rate is expected in the coming months. Taking into account that both external and domestic demand have significantly weakened, the Monetary Policy Committee considers the impact of the aforementioned factors on the inflation to be short-term in nature and these factor will not give rise to inflation risks in the medium term. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee considers necessary to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged. The phased exit out of accommodative monetary policy will be implemented together with improvement in domestic and external economic situation. According to existing forecasts by the end of 2015 inflation will remain within 5%. Annual inflation in February was 1.3%. The forecasts significantly depend on exogenous factors and contain risks of changing in both directions. The deterioration in economic trends in our main trade partners continues to affect negatively Georgian economy. In January and February merchandise exports, remittances and tourism inflows all decreased. The domestic demand has also weakened due to the increase in USD-denominated debt service costs. Hence both domestic and external demand has decreased. The output gap remains negative. The change in the exchange rate caused by the decrease in foreign currency inflows is probably sufficient to decrease import demand, which in turn will assist to restore external balance. Based on the aforementioned the aggregate demand is expected to be weak during the year and not to create inflationary pressure from demand side. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 6, 2015."
Philippines,2015-03-25,"Statement by BSP Officer-in-Charge Diwa C Guinigundo. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment continues to be manageable. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation is likely to settle within the lower half of the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2015 and 2016. The forecasts are also supported by well-anchored inflation expectations, which remain within the target band over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board likewise noted that the risks to the inflation outlook continue to be broadly balanced, with upside risks emanating from pending petitions for adjustments in utility rates and possible power shortages. Meanwhile, global economic activity has turned slightly more positive but continues to be uneven, which could further mitigate upward pressures on commodity prices. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that domestic demand conditions remain robust, owing to solid private demand, adequate domestic liquidity, and buoyant business sentiment. Higher public spending is also expected to support economic activity. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor domestic and external developments affecting the inflation outlook to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with its price and financial stability objectives."
Czech Republic,2015-03-26,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate to be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016, i.e. over the entire forecast horizon. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to domestic prices and other nominal variables. The Bank Board assesses the risks to the current forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being anti-inflationary. In this situation, the Bank Board repeated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the second half of 2016. The Czech National Bank remains ready to move the level of the exchange rate commitment if there were to be a long-term increase in deflation pressures capable of causing a slump in domestic demand, renewed risks of deflation in the Czech economy and a systematic decrease in inflation expectations. Domestic inflation was slightly above the forecast in February, but remains close to zero. This mainly reflects the drop in oil prices, which is a positive supply shock boosting Czech economic growth. It still applies that in line with its previous communication, the Czech National Bank will not respond to the first-round effects of this shock on the price level. This means it is prepared to tolerate inflation moving temporarily close to, or even slightly below, zero this year. Next year, however, the first-round effects of this shock will unwind, and it remains the Czech National Bank's intention to ensure that inflation returns towards the 2% target in line with the current forecast. As expected, annual growth of the Czech economy slowed to 1.5% in 2014 Q4. The slight downward deviation from the forecast was due to lower-than-expected additions to inventories. By contrast, the other GDP components rose faster than forecasted. Following a temporary slowdown in late 2014 and early 2015. GDP growth will, according to the forecast, accelerate gradually to 3% in 2016, boosted by a recovery in external demand, still easy monetary conditions, the positive cost effect of low oil prices and this year also a recovery in government investment. According to new information on developments abroad obtained from the March Consensus Forecasts survey, the outlook for external demand has increased slightly for this year, while the outlooks for consumer price inflation and especially for producer price inflation in the euro area have decreased. This primarily reflects the incorporation of the oil price decrease in late 2014 and early 2015. Expected inflation in the euro area next year is broadly unchanged. The current market outlook for foreign interest rates has been slightly lowered again for this year and the next, nearing zero levels. The market outlook for Brent crude oil prices has risen by about five dollars a barrel. This is due partly to a recent upward correction of oil prices, stemming chiefly from an expected decline in oil production this year. As regards oil prices in euro terms and, in turn, koruna terms, the weaker outlook for the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is acting in the same direction over the entire forecast horizon. The weaker outlook for the euro is due to the additional easing of monetary policy by the European Central Bank in a situation where the US central bank is, conversely, already preparing for the first increase in its policy rates. However, the predictions of foreign analysts entering our forecasts do not yet fully reflect the benefits to the European economy of the European Central Bank's measures and the significant weakening of the euro against the dollar. The continuing domestic economic growth is fostering a further improvement in some labour market indicators. The growth in total employment exceeds the expectations of the forecast, with growth in the number of employees accelerating, even when converted into full-time equivalents. The number of job vacancies is also increasing and reached its highest level in six years in February. The seasonally adjusted general rate of unemployment fell further at the close of last year, in line with the forecast, and the share of unemployed persons declined faster than expected in the first few months of this year. On the other hand, wage growth in the business sector lagged significantly behind the forecast in 2014 Q4. Moreover, the January figures for industry and construction do not as yet point to any marked recovery in wage growth either. However, the total volume of wages is not lagging so significantly behind the forecast and is continuing to foster growth in household consumption. We continue to view wage developments as one of the key indicators of how much the current low-inflation environment will affect prices in the longer term. Industrial production continued to show solid growth in late 2014 and early 2015, and construction output has also been rising  with some fluctuations  in recent months. Retail sales are still increasing rapidly in both the automotive segment and the segment of other non-food products. Their growth picked up further at the start of this year. Prices in manufacturing began to fall year on year in November 2014 and their decline deepened in subsequent months. However, this was due to the dramatic fall in oil prices. The year-on-year decrease in agricultural producer prices intensified as well in late 2014 and early 2015. Price growth in market services almost came to a halt in year-on-year terms in February 2015. However, prices of construction work continued to rise modestly. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, annual GDP growth was slightly below the forecast at the end of last year. By contrast, inflation was slightly higher in February. The average wage rose considerably more slowly than expected in 2014 Q4. The seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons declined slightly faster than forecasted."
South Africa,2015-03-26,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 26 March 2015 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the near-term inflation outlook has deteriorated with the partial reversal of the recent petrol price declines, emerging upside pressures on food and possible further electricity tariff increases. The rand exchange rate has depreciated further, adding to upside inflation risks, against the backdrop of the expected, but uncertain, tightening of US monetary policy. The domestic economy, however, remains weak amid electricity supply constraints, and relatively subdued domestic demand. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,4 per cent and 3,9 per cent in January and February respectively. The lower trend in inflation was mainly due to lower petrol prices, but recent oil price and exchange rate developments suggest that this is likely to be the low point for the medium term inflation trajectory. The February outcome was marginally above market consensus and the Bank's forecast of 3,8 per cent, partly as a result of higher than expected health insurance price inflation of 9,6 per cent. 1 Petrol prices declined by 26,6 per cent in February, while food price inflation measured 6,5 per cent in February, down from 6,6 per cent in January. By contrast, core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, remained near the upper end of the inflation target range, having measured 5,8 per cent in both January and February. The favourable impact of the lower oil price was also evident in the headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods, which measured 3,5 per cent and 2,6 per cent in January and February respectively compared with 6,5 per cent and 5,8 per cent in the preceding two months. The downward trend is also expected to reverse in the face of adverse fuel and food price developments. According to the Bank's latest forecasts, inflation is now expected to average 4,8 per cent in 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 3,8 per cent. A first quarter average of 4,2 per cent is now projected as the low point, compared with 3,5 per cent previously. The strong base effects in the first quarter of 2016 are expected to result in a temporary one-quarter breach of the inflation target during that quarter, at 6,7 per cent, with the average for the year expected to measure 5,9 per cent compared with 5,4 per cent previously. Inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent in the final quarter of the year, compared with the previous forecast of 5,3 per cent. The forecast for core inflation is more or less unchanged at 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2015 and 2016 respectively, the latter up marginally from 5,1 per cent. The peak is still expected at 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. The deterioration in the headline forecast is due to an expected acceleration in food price inflation, and 2. The deterioration in the headline forecast is due to an expected acceleration in food price inflation, and 2 the impact of the higher fuel and Road Accident Fund levies on the petrol price, due to be implemented in April. This is in addition to the current under-recovery on the petrol price. The international oil price assumption remains unchanged from the previous meeting, with a moderate increase over the next two years. The electricity price assumption is also unchanged, with increases of 11,6 per cent assumed from July 2015 and July 2016. However, there is a high possibility of significant further electricity tariff increases. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey conducted in the first quarter of 2015, improved for all respondents for 2015, but returned to levels around the upper end of the target range in the next two years. On average, expectations for 2015 declined from 5,8 per cent to 5,4 per cent, with a one percentage point decline in the expectations of analysts to 4,4 per cent, and a 0,2 percentage point decline in expectations of business people and trade union officials to 6,0 per cent and 5,7 per cent respectively. However, expectations for 2016 and 2017 are higher, with expectations of the categories of respondents ranging between 5,6 per cent and 6,2 per cent in 2016, and between 5,3 per cent and 6,3 per cent in 2017. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, with a moderate slowdown in the US and China, and an improvement in the outlook and performance of the euro area and Japan. The US grew at a rate of 2,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from 5,0 per cent in the previous quarter, as the stronger dollar impacted negatively on export growth and investment. Nevertheless, the longer term growth outlook remains positive. By contrast, the weaker euro and accommodative ECB monetary 3. By contrast, the weaker euro and accommodative ECB monetary 3 policy have contributed to improved growth prospects in the region, particularly in the core countries. In the fourth quarter of 2014, euro area growth surprised on the upside at 1,3 per cent and ECB forecasts for 2015 have been revised upwards by 0,5 percentage points to 1,5 per cent. The Japanese economy emerged from two quarters of negative growth, recording a growth rate of 1,5 per cent in the fourth quarter. The larger emerging markets continued to be a drag on global growth. China's economic prospects remain relatively subdued with most domestic demand indicators weakening since the beginning of the year. Consensus forecasts are for both Russia and Brazil to record negative growth rates in 2015. The outlook for the Indian economy, by contrast, is more positive. Global financial markets continue to be dominated by changing expectations of the timing and speed of normalisation of US monetary policy. Favourable labour market data in the past weeks in the US resulted in a strong appreciation of the US dollar against most currencies, as expectations of the start of policy tightening were brought forward. However, these expectations were tempered following the March FOMC meeting where the growth and inflation forecasts were downgraded. Uncertainty persists regarding the timing of the first interest rate increase. The FOMC has not only re-emphasised the gradual nature of the expected path of interest rates, but the members' individual expectations of the interest rate path were also revised down significantly. In response to this guidance, the dollar weakened somewhat against most currencies. 4 While the US prepares to tighten monetary policy, the global trend has generally been towards policy easing or maintaining an accommodative bias. Both Japan and the euro area have continued with their quantitative easing while a number of countries have eased their policy further, amid benign inflation pressures and concerns about deflation in some countries. The volatile global trends were reflected in the high degree of volatility in the rand/dollar exchange rate. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand depreciated by about two per cent against the US dollar, but traded in a wide band of around R11,27 and R12,52 against the dollar, with a marked recovery after the recent FOMC meeting. Over the same period, the rand was more or less unchanged against the euro. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand depreciated by 0,7 per cent. Although the rand movement reflected US dollar strength to a large degree, the rand was also negatively impacted by domestic factors including the weak January trade data, and issues relating to Eskom and the domestic growth outlook. The rand is expected to remain volatile while uncertainty regarding the outlook for US monetary policy persists. The commencement of US interest rate increases, when it happens, is expected to put the currency under pressure. The rand is also expected to remain sensitive to developments on the current account of the balance of payments. The marked narrowing of the trade account in the fourth quarter, reflective of higher export volumes and lower import volumes, contributed to the narrowing of the deficit to 5,1 per cent of GDP in that quarter, and to 5,4 per cent for the year. At this stage it is unclear whether or not this represents the beginning of a sustained compression of the current account, after a long period of real exchange 5. At this stage it is unclear whether or not this represents the beginning of a sustained compression of the current account, after a long period of real exchange 5 rate depreciation. While lower international oil prices are expected to continue to impact favourably on the import bill, as oil imports account for just under 20 per cent of merchandise imports, the wide trade deficit in January, should it persist, suggests that the adjustment may remain slow. Although the current account deficit to date has been relatively comfortably financed, the global capital flow environment is increasingly challenging, particularly against the backdrop of expected increases in US interest rates. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the deficit was financed primarily through flows into the banking sector. Year to date, net sales of bonds and equities by non-residents as reported by the exchanges, suggest that net portfolio flows on the financial account of the balance of payments in the first quarter may be negative for the second consecutive quarter. The outlook for the domestic economy remains overshadowed by the electricity supply constraint, which appears to have had an adverse effect on recent economic activity. This constraint is likely to persist for some time, and has resulted in a downward revision of short-term potential output to between 2,0 and 2,5 per cent. Nevertheless, some improvement on the 2014 growth rate of 1,5 per cent is expected in 2015, in the absence of protracted work stoppages. The Bank's growth forecast for 2015 is unchanged at 2,2 per cent, and marginally lower at 2,3 per cent for 2016. The Bank's leading indicator of economic activity, which had followed a moderately declining trend in 2014, also suggests a continuation of the sluggish growth outlook. 6 Underlying this outlook is the continued weakness in growth of gross fixed capital formation, which contracted by 0,4 per cent during 2014, with private sector fixed investment contracting by 3,4 per cent, despite some recovery in the final quarter of the year. The main contribution to fixed capital formation came from general government, which accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total. With business confidence subdued, and amid binding electricity supply constraints, the prospects for a meaningful acceleration remain weak. Initial high frequency data for 2015 are also a cause for concern, should the trends persist. Both real mining and manufacturing output contracted on a month-on-month basis in January; the Kagiso PMI declined sharply to below the neutral 50 level in February; the RMB/BER business confidence index declined to below the neutral 50 level in the first quarter of 2015 to 49 points, with the decline most marked in the manufacturing sector; and the building sector also shows signs of slowing, with both buildings completed and new plans passed declining, along with lower confidence in the sector, particularly with respect to residential construction. Against this backdrop, employment growth has stagnated and likely to remain low: according to the Quarterly Employment Statistics of Statistics South Africa, formal sector non-agricultural employment contracted by 0,2 per cent over four quarters in the final quarter of 2014, with growth in public sector employment more than offset by job-shedding in the private sector. Growth in final consumption expenditure by households increased marginally to an annualised quarterly rate of 1,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014, and measured 1,4 per cent over the year. Both retail trade and wholesale trade sales declined on a 7. Both retail trade and wholesale trade sales declined on a 7 month-to-month basis in January, and the outlook remains uncertain as the potential boost to consumption from lower petrol prices has been partially reversed. However, confidence of retailers, particularly of durable goods, remains relatively high. High debt levels, low employment growth and continued tight credit conditions are likely to constrain consumption expenditure growth in the absence of strong increases in real disposable incomes or strong positive wealth effects. Fiscal policy is set to continue on its consolidation path. As outlined in the recent Budget Review, the projected deficit for both 2014/15 and 2015/16 is estimated at 3,9 per cent of GDP, despite lower GDP growth forecasts, and is expected to narrow to 2,5 per cent of GDP by 2017/18. This is envisaged to be achieved through a combination of lower expenditure compared with the 2014 budget estimate and higher tax revenues. This is expected to exert a moderate constraining effect on household consumption expenditure growth. Trends in bank credit extension to the private sector have remained relatively unchanged, with highly divergent patterns in loans granted to the corporate and household sectors. While growth over twelve months in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,3 per cent in January, credit extended to corporates increased by 14,3 per cent while that to households increased by 3,5 per cent. Growth across all the main categories of credit extension to households has remained subdued in recent months, despite a slight increase in unsecured lending off a low base. Both mortgage credit extension and instalment credit and leasing finance reflected slow growth in housing and motor vehicle sales. Commercial mortgages, by contrast, experienced buoyant growth. 8 The recent higher trend in wage settlements has the potential to put further upside pressure on inflation. Nominal remuneration per worker over four quarters increased by 7,7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014, and, after accounting for changes in labour productivity, resulted in a unit labour cost increase of 6,2 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent in the previous quarter. The Andrew Levy Employment Publications survey shows that during 2014, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 8,1 per cent, compared with 7,9 per cent in 2013. The public sector wage settlement is still not agreed, and the outcome is expected to have an important bearing on the general trend of wage settlements in the economy in 2015. The recent downward trend in consumer food price inflation is forecast to be reversed in the coming months, following the severe drought in some of the maize producing areas of the country. With drastically reduced maize crop estimates. South Africa is expected to become a net importer of maize during the year, and spot prices have moved closer to import parity. The spot price of white maize, for example, has increased by around 30 per cent since the beginning of the year, reinforced by a depreciating currency and despite moderating global prices. Meat prices have also remained elevated. International oil prices have been relatively volatile but at vastly lower levels than those prevailing for much of 2014. Having reached a low of around US$45 per barrel in January. Brent crude oil prices increased to around US$62 per barrel at the end of February, before declining to current levels of around US$57 per barrel. The partial 9 recovery in the international oil price, in conjunction with the recent depreciation of the rand against the US dollar, and the impending fuel and RAF levies, will have reversed a large part of the favourable impact on domestic petrol prices, which had declined by about R4 per litre between August 2014 and February 2015. The respite to the headline inflation outlook from lower international oil prices appears to have been short-lived. However, the expected breach of the target range in 2016 is likely to be temporary and the main drivers of the deterioration of the inflation forecast are exogenous. While the MPC will look through these developments, the Committee remains concerned about the possible impact on inflation expectations which remain at the upper end of the target range over the longer term. The rand exchange rate continues to be the main upside risk to the inflation outlook, and remains highly vulnerable to the timing and pace of US monetary policy normalisation. The extent to which US rate increases are priced into the exchange rate remains uncertain. While the weaker euro has provided some offset, and therefore a more moderate depreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate, this effect is partial. Furthermore, the rand will also remain sensitive to domestic developments, including the slow pace of contraction in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. Wage and salary increases in excess of inflation and productivity growth also pose an upside risk to inflation. The Committee assesses the risk to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, with the possibility of further electricity tariff increases accentuating this risk. 10 At the same time, the growth outlook remains constrained by electricity supply concerns and low business confidence, and the risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be moderately on the downside. Demand pressures on inflation remain muted, reinforced by a moderately tighter fiscal policy stance. In its previous statement the Committee noted that the more favourable inflation path allowed for some room to pause in the process of domestic monetary policy normalisation. The deterioration in the outlook suggests that this scope has narrowed. However, given the uncertainties related to US policy normalisation and the weak state of the domestic economy, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now. The timing of future interest rate increases will be dependent, as before, on a range of domestic and external factors. The MPC will remain vigilant and will not hesitate to act in order to maintain the integrity of the inflation targeting framework.

Ukraine,2015-03-30,"The regular meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Ukraine (hereinafter  the Committee) was held on March 25  26, 2015. The first day of the Committee's meeting was devoted to presentations by experts from the NBU's respective subdivisions, who expressed their views about future developments in the money market and provided their insight into the current economic situation and an updated macroeconomic outlook. While hearing presentations by experts, the Committee members expressed their stance and views on the issues in question."". On the second day of the meeting, the Committee members adopted decisions on the following:. 1) to keep the discount rate at its current 30% and leave other monetary policy parameters unchanged. Having considered the current situation in the foreign exchange market and the macroeconomic outlook, the decision was taken to recommend to the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine that the discount rate be kept at its current 30%. The tension in the foreign exchange market has shown some signs of abating over the past weeks. At the same time, the risks for renewed money market instability remain in place, and so do strong inflation and depreciation expectations. With a view to preventing these risks from materializing and putting inflation firmly on a downward path, the National Bank of Ukraine should proceed with its policy of ""expensive hryvnia"" by keeping interest rates high. As the risks to the hryvnia's stability abate, the National Bank of Ukraine is set to gradually lower its interest rates. Whether the monetary policy will be eased will hinge on the successful implementation of structural reforms, fiscal consolidation and the rehabilitation of the banking system, i.e. the fundamental factors underlying the dynamics of the hryvnia exchange rate;. 2) to approve the proposals for a new version of the Monetary Policy Fundamentals for 2015, which are subject for approval by the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine. The National Bank of Ukraine Council held its meeting on February 26, 2015. Following this meeting, the decision was taken to recommend the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine prepare amendments to the Monetary Policy Fundamentals for 2015. Pursuant to the Law On the National Bank of Ukraine, the macroeconomic indicators calculated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine shall be used when elaborating the Monetary Policy Fundamentals. In line with the provisions set forth in the aforementioned law, the projections set out in the Monetary Policy Fundamentals for 2015 are inconsistent with scenario 1 of the revised Outlook for the economic and social development of Ukraine for 2015 approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. This scenario is broadly in line with the projections underlying a new Extended Fund Facility arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter  the EFF arrangement). The Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, and Technical Memorandum of Understanding lay out the focal points of the monetary and exchange rate policy under the EFF arrangement and provide for the need for quantitative performance criteria to be met. The timely fulfilment of monetary policy commitments is crucial for successful review under the EFF arrangement and the disbursement of next tranches. In view of the above, the proposals for the Monetary Policy Fundamentals for 2015 are based on the following main principles:. - the fulfilment of commitments under the IMF's EFF, including in terms of meeting quantitative performance criteria;. - the adoption of inflation targeting when the necessary macroeconomic prerequisites are in place;. - achievement and maintenance of low stable inflation rates of 5% a year on the CPI measure in the mid term (from 3 to 5 years), with a permissible deviation of+/-1 p.p. The aforementioned paper will be sent to the Council of the National Bank of Ukraine to be taken into account when drafting amendments to the Monetary Policy Fundamentals for 2015;. 3) to approve the Inflation Report, including its section containing inflation projections, and endorse its publication. The Macroeconomic Outlook for 2015  2016 proceeds from the assumption that Ukraine will stay on track with its commitments under the EFF arrangement, including commitments to undertake energy, fiscal and financial sector reforms and general economic reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and set the stage for robust economic growth. According to estimates by the National Bank of Ukraine, in 2015 Q1. GDP continued to decline quarter-on-quarter on seasonally adjusted terms amid the ongoing military conflict. Economic growth is expected to resume in Q2 2015, driven primarily by net export growth and the utilization of spare capacity. Overall. GDP is expected to contact by 7.5% in 2015 due to the statistical base effect. A pick-up in investment demand is expected in the second half of 2015 due to stronger import substitution effects and the reconstruction of the destroyed infrastructure in the east of the country. Imports will remain weak due to the depreciation of the hryvnia exchange rate that occurred in the previous periods. Real GDP is projected to rebound as early as in 2016, growing at an annualized rate of 3%. As a result of contraction in non-energy imports, net exports will contribute significantly to GDP growth. In 2015, the current account deficit is expected to narrow to about 1% of GDP in 2015-2016 due to the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate by 19.2% in 2014 and by 2.4% у 2015. In 2015-2016, the financial account of the Balance of Payments will run a surplus due to substantial amounts of official external financing and the expected deferral of sovereign euro bond repayments. This, together with the IMF's financing, the lion's share of which is expected this year, will help restore the international reserves, bringing them up to USD 18 billion and covering more than 3 months of future imports. The deep hryvnia depreciation and dramatic increases in the prices of housing and utilities have led to the outlook for CPI inflation and that for core inflation being revised upwards to 30% and 25% respectively by end-2015. Inflation will peak in the first half of the year, as pass-through from the currency depreciation is the most significant over the first two quarters and frontloaded increases in the prices of housing and utilities are scheduled for Q2 2015. Weak consumer demand and decreasing world prices are among the factors containing inflation. As the impact of exchange rate depreciation dies out and price increases in housing and utilities slow down. CPI inflation and core inflation will moderate to 13% yoy and 8% yoy respectively by end-2016, given the National Bank of Ukraine's strong commitment to anti-inflation policies. The full version of the Inflation Report will be published on the NBU's official website on April 2, 2015. As a side note, the Committee has been revamped to include the newly appointed Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine Dmytro Sologub and Director of the NBU Financial Stability Department Vitalii Vavryshchuk. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on April 22  23, 2015."
Romania,2015-03-31,"The analysis of the latest data points to the annual inflation rate staying below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target, alongside emerging signals of a halt in the significant decline seen previously. This occurs amid a relatively slower year-on-year fall in fuel prices and volatile food prices, as well as the persistence of a negative output gap and euro area deflation. In February 2015, the annual inflation rate and the average annual inflation rate stayed unchanged versus the previous month at 0.4 percent and 1.0 percent respectively. The average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, dropped to 1.2 percent, from 1.3 percent in the prior month. As for the economic activity, national accounts data for the final quarter of 2014 point to real GDP advancing by 2.6 percent in annual terms, on the back of further rising final consumption and a positive contribution, for the first time in two years, from gross fixed capital formation. Nearly all monthly indicators for the early months of this year, especially those on retail trade and consumer confidence, hint at the consolidation of the economic growth trend in the period ahead. Domestic currency loans grew at a swifter pace in annual terms, against the background of the ongoing liquidity surplus in the money market and the pass-through of the successive policy rate cuts onto lending rates on new business to companies and households. On the other hand, forex loans contracted at a slightly faster rate year on year, their share in total credit to the private sector narrowing to 56.1 percent in February, down from 56.4 percent a month earlier. The real annual dynamics of credit to the private sector remained however in negative territory, reducing further the level of financial intermediation. Looking ahead, evidence so far suggests the annual inflation rate embarking on a slight uptrend, still below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target, reflecting in particular the combined effect of developments in volatile prices and of the narrowing, yet still significant negative output gap. The uncertainty surrounding this outlook arises from both the external environment  mostly from the geopolitical tensions in the region, the situation in Greece and the euro area, and from the growing divergence between the monetary policy stances pursued by major central banks worldwide  and the domestic environment. Against this background, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 2.00 percent per annum from 2.25 percent starting 1 April 2015 and to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. With a view to containing interbank money market rate volatility and strengthening the transmission of the policy rate signal, the NBR Board moved to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±1.75 percentage points from ±2.00 percentage points. Accordingly, starting 1 April 2015, the interest rate on the deposit facility remains at 0.25 percent per annum and that on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) is lowered to an annual 3.75 percent. The NBR Board also decided to keep unchanged the current levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on liabilities of credit institutions. These levels will be adjusted, in compliance with the long-term programme for bringing them into line with European levels, when domestic and external conditions allow it. Based on currently available data, the decisions are meant to ensure price stability over the medium term, in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target, in a manner supportive of economic growth, also by restoring confidence and reinvigorating lending. The NBR Board reiterates that the consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix and the step-up in structural reforms, together with sustainable financial intermediation and an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits are pivotal to consolidating the Romanian economy and enhancing its resilience to external shocks. The NBR is restating that the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools, amid close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, will ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. In line with the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 6 May 2015, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined.

India,2015-04-07,"First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2015-16 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.5 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); and continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.5 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.5 per cent. Assessment 2. Since 2014-15's sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February, a moderate and uneven global recovery is emerging, with economies being buffeted (or supported) by currency fluctuations and commodity prices. Growth in the United States is likely to have been weak in the first quarter of calendar 2015, partly because of US dollar appreciation, but is expected to strengthen. The Euro area has started to show modest improvement, supported by a boost to demand from lower crude prices and the depreciation of the euro as well as easing financial and credit conditions following the commencement of quantitative easing. With the waning of the impact of the consumption tax increase, growth turned positive in Japan in Q4 of 2014 and consumer confidence and exports picked up. However, retail sales and industrial production contracted, indicating that the outlook is still weak. Growth continues to slow in China amidst financial fragilities and macroeconomic imbalances. This will have regional and global ramifications, although the softness in international commodity prices is providing some offset for net importers while adversely impacting net exporters. Global growth is likely to firm up through 2015 and 2016, supported by stronger recovery in the advanced economies (AEs) and soft energy prices. Downside risks mainly emanate from the slowdown in China, geopolitical risks surrounding oil prices and the uneven effects of currency and commodity price movements.2 3. Global financial markets have been boosted by expectations of normalisation of US monetary policy being pushed back into late 2015, monetary policy stances turning highly accommodative in other AEs, and several emerging market economies (EMEs) easing policy rates to address growth concerns. Long-term yields have declined to all-time lows on weak inflation expectations, compression of term premiums and the safe haven allure of US Treasuries. Ultra low interest rates and reduction in risk premia have raised most asset prices to record highs, and have pushed investors to riskier assets such as equity and lower rated debt instruments. Exchange rates have experienced large and volatile movements, with the US dollar strengthening against most currencies. Among EMEs, markets have tended to discriminate against those with relatively weaker fundamentals and/or oil exporters. Nevertheless, with high portfolio flows to EMEs, risks from sudden shifts in market sentiment have increased. Domestic economic activity is likely to have strengthened in Q4. Second advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture suggest that the contraction in food grains production in 2014-15 may turn out to be less than earlier anticipated. However, the adverse impact of unseasonal rains and hailstorms in March is still unfolding. Initial estimates indicate that as much as 17 per cent of the sown area under the rabi crop may have been affected though the precise extent of the damage remains to be determined. The growth in allied activities is likely to remain strong as in the recent past, though it remains to be seen whether it will fully compensate the decline in food grains output. The industrial sector, and in particular, manufacturing appears to be regaining momentum, with the growth of production in positive territory for three consecutive months till January. While basic goods production has been expanding steadily since November 2013, capital goods output has been relatively lumpy and volatile, and more positive readings are needed to be confident about a durable pick-up in investment demand. The persisting contraction in consumer durables production for over two years could be reflecting the underlying weakness in consumption demand as well as higher imports. Mixed signals are coming from the service sector. While the national accounts statistics seem to suggest that consumption demand for services is robust relative to the demand for goods, and purchasing managers perceive activity expanding on new orders, various coincident indicators of services sector activity including railway and port traffic, domestic and international passenger traffic, international freight traffic, tourist arrivals, motorcycle and tractor sales as well as bank credit and deposit growth remain subdued. Retail inflation measured by the year-on-year changes in the revised consumer price index (CPI) firmed up for the third successive month in February as favourable base effects dissipated, despite the price index remaining virtually flat since December. The still elevated levels of prices of protein-rich items such as pulses, meat, fish and milk kept food inflation from following the seasonal decline in prices of vegetables and fruits. The prices of items such as sugar and edible oil moderated in3 consonance with the downturn in global commodity prices. Fuel inflation edged up for the second month in a row due to the increase in prices of electricity and firewood. Inflation excluding food and fuel fell successively in the nine months till February. A large part of this disinflation has been on account of the slump in international crude oil prices feeding through into domestic prices of petrol and diesel that are included under the category transport and communication. Inflation in respect of housing has also eased in the revised CPI, in part reflecting methodological and coverage improvements. Furthermore, upside pressures affecting prices of services such as education, health and other services have also fallen on account of weak demand conditions. The rate of growth of rural wages has come off substantially from the double digit levels that prevailed up to November 2013. Firms are also reporting a substantial easing of input price pressures, barring the most recent purchasing manager surveys. Reflecting past disinflation, inflation expectations of households are in single digits, although they too exhibit some firming up in Q4 in response to the turning up of food and fuel inflation during January- February. Since the shift in the monetary policy stance in January towards accommodation, the Reserve Bank has moved to ensure comfortable liquidity conditions through pro-active liquidity management, including fine-tuning operations on week days and access to the MSF and fixed rate reverse repo on Saturdays. This has helped to smooth the liquidity frictions that characterise events such as advance tax payments and balance sheet dates, keeping the money market rates anchored to the repo rate. In order to alleviate the pressures that build up in March on account of frictional factors, the Reserve Bank augmented its liquidity management instruments by engaging in repos of maturities ranging from 8 to 28 days cumulating to an outstanding amount of 1430 billion (including support from the MSF of 416 billion) at end-March in addition to regular 14-day term repo auctions and fixed rate overnight repos. The availability of liquidity can be gauged from the fact that in March, average daily liquidity returned by market participations through variable/fixed rate reverse repos amounted to 293 billion. Export performance has been progressively weakening and contraction set in on both non-oil and petroleum product exports since December 2014. Fragile external demand conditions and the softness in international commodity prices have taken a heavy toll, as in several other EMEs in Asia. In particular, price realisations have been eroded, despite export volumes going up. With the Indian rupee gaining in real effective terms, export margins are coming under pressure for those exporters without substantial imported inputs. Net terms of trade gains and compression in imports of petroleum products have narrowed the trade deficit in the last three months to its lowest level since 2009-10. Gold imports remained contained; although non-oil non-gold imports grew at a modest pace in these months, they may be reflecting substitution effects in view of the sluggishness in domestic manufacturing. Exports of services, particularly, software and travel have provided a silver lining and have helped to hold down the current account deficit (CAD) which has narrowed in Q3. This improvement has likely extended into Q4. As a result, capital4 inflows – mainly portfolio flows into domestic debt and equity markets and foreign direct investment – have exceeded the external financing requirement and enabled accretion to the foreign exchange reserves which reached an all-time peak of US$ 343 billion as on April 3, 2015. These reserves, including forward purchases that will be delivered over the next few months, provide some buffer against potential capital outflows when monetary policy normalisation in AEs commences. Good macroeconomic policy will, of course, be the critical first line of defence in retaining investor confidence. Policy Stance and Rationale 12. In 2015 so far, the inflation path has evolved along the projected path after a sizable undershoot of the January 2015 target. CPI inflation is projected at its current levels in the first quarter of 2015-16, moderating thereafter to around 4 per cent by August but firming up to reach 5.8 per cent by the end of the year (Chart 1). There are upside risks to the central projection emanating from possible intensification of el niño conditions leading to a less than normal monsoon; large deviations in vegetable and fruit prices from their regular seasonal patterns, given unseasonal rains; larger than anticipated administered price revisions; faster closing of the output gap; geo- political developments leading to hardening of global commodity prices; and spillover from external developments through exchange rate and asset price channels. However, at this juncture, these upside risks appear to be offset by downsides originating from global deflationary/disinflationary tendencies, the still soft outlook on global commodity prices; and slack in the domestic economy. Transmission of policy rates to lending rates has not taken place so far despite weak credit off take and the front loading of two rate cuts. With little transmission, and the possibility that incoming data will provide more clarity on the balance of risks on inflation, the Reserve Bank will maintain status quo in its monetary policy stance in this review. The Monetary Policy Framework Agreement signed by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank in February 2015 will shape the stance of monetary policy in 2015-16 and succeeding years. The Reserve Bank will stay focussed on ensuring5 that the economy disinflates gradually and durably, with CPI inflation targeted at 6 per cent by January 2016 and at 4 per cent by the end of 2017-18. Although the target for end-2017-18 and thereafter is defined in terms of a tolerance band of +/- 2 per cent around the mid-point, it will be the Reserve Bank's endeavour to keep inflation at or close to this mid-point, with the extended period provided for achieving the mid-point mitigating potentially adverse effects on the economy. As outlined above, several favourable forces are at work, consistent with the change in the monetary policy stance towards accommodation effected from January. The Reserve Bank's intent is to allow the disinflationary momentum to spread through the economy, but remain vigilant about any resurgence of inflationary pressures that may destabilise the progress towards the inflation objectives set in the Agreement. The outlook for growth is improving gradually. Comfortable liquidity conditions should enable banks to transmit the recent reductions in the policy rate into their lending rates, thereby improving financing conditions for the productive sectors of the economy. Along with initiatives announced in the Union Budget to boost investment in infrastructure and to improve the business environment, these factors should provide confidence to private investment and, together with the conducive outlook on inflation, deliver real income gains to consumers and lower input cost advantages to corporates. GDP growth estimates of the CSO for 2014-15 already project a robust pick-up, but leading and coincident indicators suggest a downward revision of these estimates when fuller information on real activity for the last quarter becomes available. Uncertainty surrounding the arrival and distribution of the monsoon and unanticipated global developments are the two major risks to baseline growth projections. Assuming a normal monsoon, continuation of the cyclical upturn in a supportive policy environment, and no major structural change or supply shocks, output growth for 2015-16 is projected at 7.8 per cent, higher by 30 bps from 7.5 per cent in 2014-15, but with a downward bias to reflect the still subdued indicators of economic activity (Chart 2). Going forward, the accommodative stance of monetary policy will be maintained, but monetary policy actions will be conditioned by incoming data. First, the Reserve Bank will await the transmission by banks of its front-loaded rate6 reductions in January and February into their lending rates. Second, developments in sectoral prices, especially those of food, will be monitored, as will the effects of recent weather disturbances and the likely strength of the monsoon, as the Reserve Bank stays vigilant to any threats to the disinflation that is underway. The Reserve Bank will look through both seasonal as well as base effects. Third, the Reserve Bank will look to a continuation and even acceleration of policy efforts to unclog the supply response so as to make available key inputs such as power and land. Further progress on repurposing of public spending from poorly targeted subsidies towards public investment and on reducing the pipeline of stalled investment will also be helpful in containing supply constraints and creating room for monetary accommodation. Finally, the Reserve Bank will watch for signs of normalisation of the US monetary policy, though it anticipates India is better buffered against likely volatility than in the past. Part B: Developmental and Regulatory Policies 17. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures to be taken for strengthening the banking structure; broadening and deepening financial markets and extending the reach of financial services to all. Monetary Policy Framework 18. Steps taken to revise the monetary policy framework are documented in the accompanying Monetary Policy Report. Banking Structure 19. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the final rules on the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) in October 2014. The Reserve Bank has already started phasing in implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from January 2015 and is committed to the scheduled implementation of NSFR from January 1, 2018 for banks in India. The Reserve Bank proposes to issue draft guidelines on NSFR by May 15, 2015. Guidelines on Countercyclical Capital Buffers (CCCB) were issued on February 5, 2015. They advised that the CCCB would be activated as and when circumstances warrant, and that the decision would normally be pre-announced with a lead time of four quarters. The framework envisages the credit-to-GDP gap as the main indicator which may be used in conjunction with other supplementary indicators such as the incremental credit-deposit (C-D) ratio for a moving period of three years, the industrial outlook survey (IOS) assessment index and the interest coverage ratio. A review and empirical testing of these indicators was carried out to assess whether activation of the CCCB is warranted. It was concluded that the overall situation does not warrant imposition of CCCB at this point of time.7 21. In July 2014, banks were allowed to issue long term bonds (LTBs), with exemptions from certain regulatory pre-emptions, for lending to long-term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and affordable housing. However, cross-holding of such bonds amongst banks is currently not permitted. On a review, it has been decided to allow banks to invest in such bonds issued by other banks, subject to the following conditions: banks' investment in these bonds will not be treated as ‘assets with the banking system in India' for the purpose of calculation of NDTL; and any single bank's holding of bonds in a particular issue will be subject to certain limits in relation to the bond issue size. Its aggregate holding of such bonds will also be subject to certain limits in relation to its own assets. iii) LTBs held for trading will reduce the bank's priority sector and liquidity benefits obtained from its own issuance of LTBs. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. For monetary transmission to occur, lending rates have to be sensitive to the policy rate. With the introduction of the Base Rate on July 1, 2010 banks could set their actual lending rates on loans and advances with reference to the Base Rate. At present, banks are following different methodologies in computing their Base Rate – on the basis of average cost of funds, marginal cost of funds or blended cost of funds (liabilities). Base Rates based on marginal cost of funds should be more sensitive to changes in the policy rates. In order to improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, the Reserve Bank will encourage banks to move in a time-bound manner to marginal-cost-of-funds-based determination of their Base Rate. Detailed guidelines will be issued shortly. The Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd., jointly floated by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA), the Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association of India (FEDAI) and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), has been established as an independent benchmark administrator. This administrator will start operations by end-May 2015. Once it starts publishing various indices of market interest rates, the Reserve Bank will explore the possibility of encouraging banks to use the indices as an external benchmark for pricing bank products. The Reserve Bank has been prescribing a comprehensive ‘Calendar of Reviews' to be deliberated by the boards of banks, with significant additions to the calendar over the years. Time spent on reviews reduces the leeway for the board to discuss issues of strategic importance for banks such as product market strategy and risk management. The Committee to Review Governance of Boards of Banks in India (Chairman: Dr.P.J.Nayak) recommended that discussions in the boards of banks need to be upgraded and greater focus should be on strategic issues. It is, therefore, proposed to do away with the mandatory calendar of reviews and instead, replace it with the seven critical themes prescribed by the Nayak Committee namely, business strategy, financial reports and their integrity, risk, compliance, customer protection, financial inclusion and human resources, and leave it to the banks' boards to determine other list of items to be deliberated and periodicity thereof.8 25. The need to bring in professionalism to the boards of banks cannot be overemphasized. In order to attract and retain professional directors, it is essential that they are appropriately compensated. Public sector banks follow guidelines issued by the government in this regard. The remuneration of the part-time Chairmen of private sector banks are approved specifically for each bank under the current statutory provisions. However, there is no guidance on remuneration to other non- executive directors of private sector banks. Therefore, it is proposed: to issue guidelines to private sector banks on a policy on remuneration for the non-executive directors (other than part-time Chairman) that will reflect market realities and will be within the parameters specified in the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and the Companies Act, 2013; and to discuss with the Government the adoption of a similar remuneration policy for the non-executive directors of the public sector banks. With a view to enlarging the scope of urban co-operative banks for expanding their business, it has been decided to allow financially sound and well managed (FSWM) scheduled urban co-operative banks, which are CBS-enabled and having minimum net worth of 100 crore, to issue credit cards. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. Similarly, with a view to providing greater freedom to state co-operative banks to expand their business and to provide technology-enabled services to their customers, it has been decided to permit state co-operative banks satisfying certain eligibility criteria to set up off-site ATMs/mobile ATMs without obtaining prior approval from the Reserve Bank. Financial Markets 28. Several steps have been taken by the Reserve Bank to promote liquidity in the government securities (G-sec) market as recommended by the Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi). These include, inter alia, a) conduct of G-sec auctions at both uniform price and multiple price formats; b) change of the settlement cycle of primary auctions for treasury bills (T-bills) from T+2 to T+1 basis; and c) re- issuance of state development loans. As part of continuing measures to promote liquidity, the Reserve Bank will formulate a scheme for market making by primary dealers in semi-liquid and illiquid government securities. Details of the scheme will be worked out and implemented in consultation with market participants within the next three months. Although the G-sec market is predominantly institutional in nature, the Reserve Bank has initiated several steps to promote retail/individual investments, such as the non-competitive bidding scheme, and enabling access to the Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM). To increase participation of the retail and mid- segment investors in the G-sec market, gilt account holders (GAHs) were also extended web-based access to NDS-OM (secondary market trading platform) and9 NDS-auction platform (primary market platform) earlier. Auctions of G-secs have since moved to a more robust CBS platform (e-Kuber). Accordingly, it is now proposed to introduce a similar web-based solution for participation of all mid-segment / retail investors having gilt accounts on the e-Kuber platform. The facility is expected to be made available within the next three months. ii) Considering the need to tap private savings through G-secs, retail investors/individuals could be provided direct access to both primary and secondary market platforms without any intermediary. Hence, it is proposed to explore the creation of alternate channels of distribution (e-Distribution Channels) for G-secs by the Reserve Bank. iii) The Reserve Bank has been in consultation with all stakeholders to enable seamless movement of securities from subsidiary general ledger (SGL) form to demat form and vice versa to promote trading of G-secs on stock exchanges. Concomitantly, it has also been decided to provide demat account holders a functionality to put through trades on NDS-OM. As implementation of these reforms involves multiple agencies, it is proposed to constitute an Implementation Group with representatives from all stakeholders to roll out the measures within a period of six months. iv) The non-competitive bidding facility available to retail investors is currently applicable only to auctions of dated securities other than Treasury Bills. In the case of Treasury Bills, a different type of non-competitive bidding is permitted only for State governments, eligible provident funds, select foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds. It is proposed to allow non- competitive bidding facility in Treasury Bills to individuals as well. Details of the facility will be worked out and implemented in consultation with the Government of India. A few international financial institutions were permitted to issue rupee bonds in overseas markets, subject to certain conditions. These issues have been received with interest. The appetite for rupee debt amongst international investors is a welcome development. In view of this, it is proposed to expand, in consultation with the Government of India, the scope of such bond issues by the international financial institutions as also to permit Indian corporates eligible to raise external commercial borrowing (ECB) through issuance of rupee bonds in overseas centers with an appropriate regulatory framework. Under the present regulatory framework governing foreign exchange derivatives contracts under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), writing of options by the users on a standalone basis is not permitted. However, end-users can enter into option strategies of simultaneous buying and selling of plain vanilla European options, provided there is no net receipt of premium. With a view to encouraging hedging of forex exposures and enhancing the liquidity of the currency options market, it is proposed to permit Indian exporters and importers to write covered options on the basis of actual contracted forex exposure, subject to conditions. Detailed operating instructions shall follow separately.10 IV. Access to Finance 33. The Reserve Bank had constituted an Internal Working Group to revisit the Priority Sector guidelines. The Working Group has since submitted its report, which was placed on the Reserve Bank's website for comments/suggestions.The Working Group has, inter alia, recommended specific sub-targets for small and marginal farmers and micro enterprises and inclusion of certain specific types of social infrastructure within the ambit of priority sector lending. The working Group has also recommended introduction of tradable Priority Sector Lending Certificates as another instrument to manage deficit/surplus amongst the players within the system. The Reserve Bank will take a view on the recommendations in the light of feedback received and the guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. Taking into consideration the improvement in the Micro-Finance Institutions (MFI) sector and recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr.Nachiket Mor), there is a need to revise upwards the limit relating to total indebtedness of the borrower, eligible rural and semi-urban household annual incomes and loan amounts to be disbursed in the first cycle and in subsequent cycles as follows: Total indebtedness of a borrower, excluding educational/ medical expenses, not to exceed 1,00,000 (raised from the current limit of 50,000). ii) Loan disbursed to a borrower with a rural household annual income not exceeding 1,00,000 (enhanced from 60,000) or urban and semi-urban household income not exceeding 1,60,000 (enhanced from 1,20,000). iii) Disbursement of the loan amount not to exceed 60,000 (enhanced from 35,000) in the first cycle and 1,00,000 (enhanced from 50,000) in subsequent cycles. Several measures have been taken to ensure the timely flow of funds to the infrastructure sector. One of them was to create a separate category of non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) called NBFC-infrastructure debt fund (NBFC-IDF). These NBFCs were allowed only to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) segment under a tripartite agreement involving, among others, the project authority. Certain regulatory dispensations were also given to these NBFCs. With a view to expanding the nature of projects to which they can lend, it is proposed to allow NBFC-IDFs to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects that have completed one year of operation in the PPP segment without a tripartite agreement and to the non-PPP segment, subject to certain conditions. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. Looking ahead, the Reserve Bank's developmental and regulatory policies will continue to be guided by the five-pillar approach to improve the efficacy of monetary and liquidity management, expand financial inclusion and carry forward banking11 sector reforms by adapting the best international practices to country-specific requirements. The second bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on June 2, 2015; the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement on August 4, 2015; the fourth bi- monthly monetary policy statement on September 29, 2015; the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on December 1, 2015; and the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on February 2, 2016.

South Korea,2015-04-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and improvements have also continued in the euro area, economic growth in emerging market countries including China has slowed. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks. Looking at the Korean economy, the Committee judges that domestic demand activities such as consumption and investment appear to have improved, although exports have continued their trend of decline due mostly to decreases in the unit prices for example of petroleum products, while the sentiments of economic agents have not clearly recovered. On the employment front, the unemployment rate has risen somewhat, due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, but the employment-to- population ratio has also increased as the number of persons employed has steadily grown. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, although the negative output gap will persist for a considerable time. Despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation fell from 0.5% the month before to 0.4% in March, due mainly to decreases in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 2.1%, from 2.3% in February, owing to a slowdown in the rate of industrial product price increase. Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have accelerated in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have fallen while stock prices have risen, due largely to the Base Rate cut, to the easing of concerns about an early policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, and to inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds. The Korean won had depreciated against the US dollar but has since appreciated, affected by changes in expectations related to the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve. After depreciating, the won has also appreciated against the Japanese yen. Bank household lending has sustained its trend of increase at a level greatly exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows."
Euroarea,2015-04-15,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards non-standard monetary policy measures, on 9 March we started purchasing euro-denominated public sector securities as part of our expanded asset purchase programme, which also comprises purchases of asset-backed securities and covered bonds. Purchases are intended to run until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. When carrying out its assessment, the Governing Council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation, looking through unexpected outcomes in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. The implementation of our asset purchase programmes is proceeding smoothly, with volumes in line with the announced figure of €60 billion of securities per month. In addition, there is clear evidence that the monetary policy measures we have put in place are effective. Financial market conditions and the cost of external finance for the private sector have eased considerably over the past months and borrowing conditions for firms and households have improved notably, with a pick-up in the demand for credit. Looking ahead, our focus will be on the full implementation of our monetary policy measures. Through these measures, we will contribute to a further improvement in the economic outlook, a reduction in economic slack and a recovery in money and credit growth. Together, such developments will lead to a sustained return of inflation towards a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term and will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2014. Domestic demand, especially private consumption, continued to be the main driver behind the ongoing recovery. The latest economic indicators, including survey data up to March, suggest that the euro area economy has gained further momentum since the end of 2014. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden and strengthen gradually. Domestic demand should be further supported by ongoing improvements in financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, the lower level of the price of oil should continue to support households' real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. Furthermore, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness. However, the euro area recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. While remaining on the downside, the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area have become more balanced on account of the recent monetary policy decisions, the fall in oil prices and the lower euro exchange rate. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was -0.1% in March 2015, up from -0.3% in February and -0.6% in January. This pattern largely reflects an increase in oil prices in euro terms since mid-January. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain very low or still negative in the months ahead. Supported by the favourable impact of our monetary policy measures on aggregate demand, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption of base effects and somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to increase later in 2015 and to pick up further during 2016 and 2017. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on geopolitical, exchange rate and energy price developments. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the gradual increase in underlying growth in broad money (M3). The annual growth rate of M3 increased to 4.0% in February 2015, up from 3.7% in January. Annual growth in M3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 9.1% in February. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -0.4% in February, after -0.9% in January, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in February 2014. In this respect, the April 2015 bank lending survey confirms that improvements in lending conditions support a further recovery in loan growth, in particular for firms. Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued and continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased further to 1.0% in February 2015, after 0.9% in January. The monetary policy measures we have put in place should support further improvements both in borrowing costs for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to implement firmly the Governing Council's recent decisions. The full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective supply-side measures. In particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the implementation of product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. A swift and effective implementation of these reforms will not only lead to higher sustainable growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and encourage both households to expand consumption and firms to increase investment today, thus reinforcing the current economic recovery. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Full and consistent implementation of the Pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework. In view of the necessity to step up structural reform efforts in a number of countries, it is also important that the macroeconomic imbalance procedure is implemented effectively in order to address the excessive imbalances as identified in individual Member States."
Peru,2015-04-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2015 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the 2.0 percent target in the 2015-2016 forecast horizon and takes into account that: economic activity continues showing levels below its potential level; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range; recent international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as high volatility in financial markets and foreign exchange markets, and domestic inflation has been affected by temporary supply-side factors, which will reverse gradually. Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.76 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 2.77 percent in February to 3.02 percent in March, due mainly to the higher prices of perishable food products, meals outside the home, fuels, and the seasonal rise registered in education costs. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.91 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 2.45 percent February to 2.58 percent in March due to the seasonal increase observed in the prices of education and transportation. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations continue showing a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential GDP levels. In April, the Central Bank has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 8.0 to 7.5 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and stands ready to make changes in its monetary policy instruments if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.05 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on May 14, 2015."
Poland,2015-04-15,"Warsaw, 15 April 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 14-15 April 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at:  reference rate 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate 1.75% on an annual basis. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate, with a slight acceleration expected in 2015. In the euro area economic growth remains slow compared to other developed economies, although incoming information signals gradual improvement of economic conditions. In the United States, despite the recent deterioration of some indicators, recovery is expected to continue. In turn, economic outlook for Poland's eastern trading partners, i.e. Russia and Ukraine, remains unfavourable. After a sharp and long-lasting fall, global commodity prices have stabilised recently. This has weakened disinflationary forces in many countries. However, global price growth remains very low, and in the majority of European economies it is negative. In these conditions, major central banks are keeping interest rates close to zero and the ECB has launched government bond purchases. This has contributed to some strengthening of the zloty. In Poland, economic activity remains stable, with GDP growth in 2015 Q1 probably slightly higher than in 2014 Q4. Rising domestic demand fuelled by improving labour market situation, good financial condition of enterprises and stable expansion in lending, remains the main driver of economic growth. In turn, the relatively low, although accelerating, growth in demand on the part of Poland's main trading partners and the continued uncertainty about the prospects for demand are factors limiting economic activity in Poland. Amid moderate growth in demand and gradual improvement in labour market conditions, there is no demand pressure in the economy, and nominal wage growth remains moderate. Combined with low commodity prices, this is contributing to continuing deflation, both in terms of consumer and producer prices. Alongside that, inflation expectations continue to be very low. In the opinion of the Council, in the coming quarters price growth will remain negative, mainly due to the previously observed sharp fall in commodity prices. At the same time, the adjustment of monetary policy in March  with continuing stable economic growth, an expected recovery in the euro area and good situation in the domestic labour market  reduce the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged."
Chile,2015-04-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 April 2015 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, incoming indicators point at some improvement in output prospects for Europe, although risks remain. At the same time, a slower pace is observed in Chinese growth and the weak performance of Latin America is confirmed. In the United States, the recovery is running its course, despite weaker growth in the first quarter, which led the market to postpone the moment it expects the Fed to make the first increase in the policy rate. In this context, the dollar depreciated globally and international financial conditions improved over the previous month. Commodity prices showed mixed movements. The prices of copper and, especially, oil and its derivatives increased. Data disclosed after the publication of the last Monetary Policy Report are broadly consistent with the baseline scenario depicted in it. Output is evolving in line with expectations, although investment has evolved below what was expected. The unemployment rate dropped slightly, but job creation was low. Nominal wages remained dynamic. In March, headline inflation was lower than forecast, which was not the case for core inflation. Overall, the annual change of the CPI is still high, and its evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. Medium-term inflation expectations remain at 3%. Local financial conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Hungary,2015-04-21,"At its meeting on 21 April 2015, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 15 basis points from 1.95% to 1.80%, with effect from 22 April 2015. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pick-up in the components of domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, the unemployment continues to exceed its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for March, consumer prices show historically low dynamics; however, the rate of decline in prices slowed. The March inflation data was consistent with the projection in the March issue of the Inflation Report, but was slightly higher than market expectations. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the short-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets, subdued imported inflation, the degree of unused capacity in the economy and the moderation in inflation expectations. The rise in fuel prices was the main factor influencing inflation developments, while core inflation was broadly unchanged relative to the previous month. With the pick-up in domestic demand and owing to the increase in wages, core inflation is likely to rise gradually; however, this process may slow due to the second-round effects of low commodity prices. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. Overall, more moderate underlying inflation developments point in the direction of a low inflation environment, and therefore inflation is expected to approach levels around 3 per cent towards the end of the forecast period. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue at a rapid pace. Robust growth has been supported by both domestic and external demand. The volume of industrial production grew further, but fell relative to the previous month. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable and increased slightly in recent months, with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Rising household real income as a result of low inflation, the reduced need for deleveraging and increasing employment are expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pick up gradually, owing to the recovery in activity, the Funding for Growth Scheme and its extension. Employment was broadly unchanged in February. On the whole, international investor sentiment has been favourable in the period since the Council's latest interest rate decision. Increased uncertainty surrounding Greece, mixed incoming macroeconomic data from the US, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East adversely affected international investor sentiment, while positive macroeconomic news from the euro area contributed to an improvement in financial markets. With small fluctuations, the forint appreciated against the euro, followed by a slight correction at the end of period. Domestic risk measures and long-term government bond yields rose slightly in the period since the latest policy decision. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there is a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for a sustained period. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually. Based on data becoming available previously, the risk of second-round effects taking hold in the wake of the change in inflation expectations still remains after increasing in recent months. In the Council's judgement, if the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, the inflation outlook and the cyclical position of the economy point in the direction of a reduction in the policy rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Cautious easing of the policy rate may continue as long as it supports the achievement of the medium-term inflation target."
Turkiye,2015-04-22," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies are having a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). Yet, uncertainty in global markets and elevated food prices necessitates maintaining the cautious stance in monetary policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. Moreover, it is assessed that a measured cut in the FX deposit lending rates and a measured hike in the partial remuneration rate on Turkish lira required reserves will support financial stability. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Egypt,2015-04-23,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release April 23, 2015 In its meeting held on April 23, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 925 percen. Headline CPI increased by 155 percent (m/m) in March compared to an increase of 186 percent in February, while the annual rate increased to 1151 percent in March from 1056 percent in Februar. The bulk of the monthly developments was driven by the upward adjustments in administered prices, particularly tobacco, in addition to supply bottlenecks related to the distribution of butane cylinder. This was coupled with increases in the prices of volatile food item. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 076 percent in March compared to 110 percent in February, while the annual rate inched up to 721 percent in March after registering 715 percent in Februar. Consequently upward adjustments in administered prices and increases in the prices of volatile food items have recently widened the divergence between the headline and core inflation rate. Upside risks on the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of lower oil prices and the consequent revision in international food price forecast. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 43 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q2 to record 56 percent (y/y) in the first half of the fiscal year, supported by the record growth witnessed in the first quarte. This comes after the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth recorded 22 percent (y/y. The expansion in economic activity during 2014/2015 Q2 came on the back of the continued growth in the manufacturing sector and the expansion of tourism activities for the second consecutive quarter after several quarters of contractio. This came despite the continuous weakness in the extraction secto. In the meantime, while the widening trade deficit is stalling real GDP growth, investment remained positive for the fourth consecutive quarte. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

Ukraine,2015-04-24,"On April 22-23, 2015, the regular meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Ukraine (hereinafter  the Committee) was held, at which the decision was taken to recommend the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine keep the discount rate unchanged at its current level of 30%. During the meeting, the Committee members heard reports by NBU experts on the macroeconomic situation, inflation developments, recent money market developments and risks to the hryvnia's stability. In the course of discussions over the presentations delivered by NBU experts, the Committee members expressed their opinions and positions on the issues in question. It was pointed out that a spike in inflation in March (the year-on-year growth of the consumer price index reached 45.8%) was triggered by the substantial hryvnia exchange rate depreciation in late February 2015, and feverish consumer demand fueled by worsening expectations. However, a package of measures put in place by the National Bank, including raising interest rates and tightening administrative restrictions, enabled it not only to stabilize the situation in the forex market, but also to strengthen the domestic currency. The UAH/USD exchange rate stayed at the value of 21  23 hryvnias per USD 1 throughout most of March and April, enabling the National Bank of Ukraine to purchase foreign exchange to replenish the international reserves. Over the next months, a number of factors working in different directions will influence the future path of inflation. Scheduled increases in administered prices and utility tariffs and a certain delay in the pass-through of price increases will push up consumer prices further. March's indicators point to heightened risks of inflation rising above projections by end-2015. At the same time, as the impact of exchange rate depreciation dies out and increases in administered prices and utility tariffs slow down, tight monetary and fiscal policy, elimination of inefficient energy subsidies will contain price growth. This will primarily hold back core inflation. Further efforts to sustain stability in the foreign exchange market, which will help dispel adverse inflation and depreciation expectations, are crucial for putting inflation on a downward path. In view of the above, the Committee members concurred in the expediency of keeping the discount rate at its current level in an effort to reinforce positive trends in the money market. The Committee members expect risks to the stability of domestic currency mitigate in the short run in the absence of external shocks, thus enabling the National Bank of Ukraine to ease the monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on May 27-28, 2015."
Israel,2015-04-27,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor March increased by 0.3 percent, while forecasters had projected a slightly higher increase of 0.4 percent, on average. A rise in fuel prices led to an increase of 1.3 percent in the transport and communications componentand contributed the main part of the increase in the CPI, followed by the contribution of the housing component, which increased by 0.7 percent. There were seasonal declines in the clothing and footwear and fruit and vegetables components. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 1 percent, similar to the inflation rate over the 12 months that ended in February. Energy prices contributed 0.9 percent to the decline in the CPI measured over the previous 12 months, and food, fruit and vegetable and communications prices reduced the CPI by 0.2 percent each. CPI components representing tradable items declined by 2.4 percent in the past 12 months, and those representing nontradable items declined by 0.1 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The private forecasters' projection for the next 12 CPI readings is 1.1 percent, on average, compared to 1.2 percent last month, while expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates are 0.6 percent, compared to 0.4 percent last month. Twelve-month ahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market remain volatile, and are currently 0.8 percent, and expectations for two years are 1.1 percent. Medium-term expectations ranged around 1.5 percent, while expectations for longer terms remained stable around the midpoint of the inflation target range. Most private forecasters do not expect a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next few months; however, the Telbor curve continues to point to some probability of such a reduction. Real economic activity: Indicators of activity in the first quarter of 2015 point to a continuation of the moderategrowth rate that has prevailed in the past two years. Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft, and diamonds) in March declined by 4.6 percent, affected by, among other things, work disruptions at Israel Chemicals and a sharp decline in the export of aeronautics following an atypical increase in the previous two months. Net of these, goods exports increased by 3.3 percent in March, and declined by 0.9 percent in the first quarter. However, this figure is in dollar terms, and was negatively impacted by the strengthening of the dollar against other currencies. In March, the recovery in tourist arrivals was halted. The export of business services (excluding startup companies) increased by 1 percent in January compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. All major components of goods imports increased in March. Data from the Companies Survey for the first quarter indicate stability in business sector activity. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.4 percent in March, affected by an increase in imports of consumer goods and manufacturing inputs (in March) and in the Industrial Production index (for February). The business sector climate index continues to indicate a monthly growth rate of 0.23 percent. The Purchasing Managers Index maintainsa range around 50 points, increasing this month to 50.2. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics increased this month to its highest level since 2011, and the index compiled by Bank Hapoalim declined slightly this month, though it remains relatively high compared with its level in 2014. The labor market: Labor market data continue to present a positive picture: Labor Force Survey data for February are similar to those for January among 25-64 year olds (the main working ages), and indicate that unemployment stabilized at a low level, with the labor force participation rate and the employment rate at a high level. Over time, the survey data indicate an extended increase in employment in trade and services and stability in manufacturing employment. Nominal wages increased by 0.2 percent, and real wages by 0.1 percent, in November-January, relative to August-October (seasonally adjusted data). Stable growth continued in health tax receipts, which were about 5.5 percent higher (in nominal terms) in January-March than in the corresponding period one year ago. In January, the number of employee posts declined by 0.8 percent. Budget data: The domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in January-March was about NIS 2.5 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 0.5 billion in the corresponding period of last year. Based on trend data, tax revenues in March were higher than in previous months and higher than in the corresponding period last year, and since the beginning of the year tax revenues have increased by 5.3 percent, in real terms, compared with the corresponding period of last year. Gross domestic VAT revenues increased by 10 percent in real terms, compared with March of 2014 (7 percent net of real estate taxes). Total domestic expenditure of government ministries in January-March was about 4 percent higher, in nominal terms,than in the corresponding period of last year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on March 22, 2015, through April 24, 2015, the shekel strengthened by about 3 percent against the dollar, and by 1.3 percent against the euro. The shekel strengthened by about 1.7 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on March 22, 2015, throughApril 24, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 4 percent. Government bond yields declined on the nominal curve, similar to the global trend. The yield on unindexed bonds with 9 years to maturity declined to a low of 1.4 percent. On the CPI-indexed curve, as well, there was a moderate decline in yields. There were slight changes along the makam yield curve, and most of the curve was trading at a yield lower than the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained virtually unchanged, at about 75 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in March, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 48.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.3 percent. During April, the pace of net withdrawals from money market funds moderated. The credit market: In January, the outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 13.3 billion (1.6 percent) to around NIS 826 billion. The increase derived mostly from aboutNIS 9.1 billion in new banking credit taken out, a significant raising of funds compared with net redemptions in the past two years. In March, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 2.9 billion in bonds, slightly higher than the monthly average over the preceding 12 months of NIS 2.6 billion. There were net withdrawals from corporate bond mutual funds in March and in the first half of April, totaling about NIS 300 million. Corporate bond market spreads declined slightly in March as well, following a decline in February. Outstanding household debt increased in Januaryby NIS 1.8 billion (0.4 percent), of which housing debt increased by NIS 1.3 billion (0.4 percent). New mortgage volume increased to NIS 5.6 billion in March, with a decline in the share of mortgages extended to buyers purchasing a home as an investment, and a continued increase in the share of fixed-rate mortgages taken out. In March, the interest rate on new mortgages declined across all indexation tracks: in the unindexed track and in the CPI-indexed fixed rate track the interest rate declined by 0.1 percentage points, and in the CPI-indexed variable rate track the interest rate declined by 0.3 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.7 percent in March, and by 2.3 percent over the past 12 months. In January-February, home prices increased by 0.4 percent, and in the 12 months ending in February, they increased by 3.7 percent. The number of housing transactions declined in February for all categories of buyers, including investors, though it remains relatively elevated, apparently due to the completion of sales ofhomes that were not sold during the period of waiting for the outcome of the zero VAT law. The number of new homes available for sale increased slightly, after declining in the previous two months. The number of building starts has been high for the past two years, and is expected to support continued supply of housing in the near term. The global economy: The IMF updated its global growth forecast this month. There was an improvement in growth forecasts for the eurozone and Japan, and a downward revision in projected US growth. The IMF revised its world trade volume forecast downward, and emphasized that the moderation in its growth in recent years derives partly from long-term structural factors as well. IMF economists see a decline in the risk of deflation or recession in most major economies. In the US, disappointing data were published this month: some reflected events with only transitory effects, such as severe weather and a port workers strike on theWest Coast, and some reflected the effect of the strength of the dollar and the impact of low fuel prices on the energy market. Nonfarm payroll growth in March was markedly lower than projected; personal consumption expenditure was quite moderate in January-February, though it recovered somewhat in March; and the Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing companies declined to its lowest level in two years. The inflation environment remains low. In view of these, uncertainty continued regarding the date on which the federal funds rate will begin to lift off, and the path of interest rates derived from market expectations declined again. Activity remains very moderate in Europe, and the uncertainty continues regarding how the crisis in Greece will develop. With that, there are factors that are contributing to recovery: the weakness of the euro, easing of financial conditions, and the low energy prices. The consumer confidence index strengthened,reaching its highest level since the crisis began, industrial production in February surprised to the upside, and purchasing managers indices point to an improvement in new orders. The inflation rate remains negative. The ECB began to implement its quantitative easing program, and its economists assess that there is clear evidence of its effectiveness. Disappointing data were published in Japan, both on the production side and on the private consumption side. In China, too, current data disappointed, and against that background the central bank there adopted monetary easing measures. This month, there were no interest rate changes at the various central banks, afterthe previous month's numerous reductions. There was a mixed trend on stock markets worldwide. Commodity prices were mostly stable, while the price of a barrel of oil corrected upward, to $65, compared with $53 just prior to the previous monetary policy discussion. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for May 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflationenvironment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: v The CPI for March increased by 0.3 percent, led by fuel prices and by the housing component. The rate of inflation as measured over the past 12 months was negative 1.0 percent. Short-term inflation expectations from various sources are near the lower bound of the inflation target range, or slightly below it. Longer-term expectations remained stable around the midpoint of the target range. v Indicators of economic activity for the first quarter point to the economy continuing to grow at the moderate rate of the past two years. Companies Survey data support this assessment. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.4 percent in March, and tax revenues increased. Net of extraordinary effects, goods exports increased by 3.3 percent in March, and declined by 0.9 percent in the first quarter, in dollar terms. v The IMF revised its growth forecasts for Europe and Japan upward, and lowered its projections for US growth and world trade volume. There are signs of recovery in current eurozone data, and some of the disappointing data in the US reflect one-off factors. Market expectations indicate that the date for liftoff of the federal funds rate has been pushed off. v From the monetary policy discussion on March 22, 2015, through April 24, 2015, the shekel strengthened by 3 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 1.7 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. For the year to date, there has been an effective appreciation of 3.7 percent in the shekel, against the background of accommodative monetary policy in several major economies, amongother reasons. A decline in the projected rate of world trade growth and continued appreciation are liable to weigh on growth of exports and of the tradable sector. v The increase in home prices continues, and new mortgage volume remains elevated. The number of transactions moderated slightly in February, among investors as well. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for May 2015 will be published on May 11, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 25, 2015. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for May 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. v The CPI for March increased by 0.3 percent, led by fuel prices and by the housing component. Longer-term expectations remained stable around the midpoint of the target range. v Indicators of economic activity for the first quarter point to the economy continuing to grow at the moderate rate of the past two years. Net of extraordinary effects, goods exports increased by 3.3 percent in March, and declined by 0.9 percent in the first quarter, in dollar terms. v The IMF revised its growth forecasts for Europe and Japan upward, and lowered its projections for US growth and world trade volume. Market expectations indicate that the date for liftoff of the federal funds rate has been pushed off. v From the monetary policy discussion on March 22, 2015, through April 24, 2015, the shekel strengthened by 3 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 1.7 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. A decline in the projected rate of world trade growth and continued appreciation are liable to weigh on growth of exports and of the tradable sector. v The increase in home prices continues, and new mortgage volume remains elevated."
United States,2015-04-29,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors. The pace of job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate remained steady. A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources was little changed. Growth in household spending declined; households' real incomes rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices, and consumer sentiment remains high. Business fixed investment softened, the recovery in the housing sector remained slow, and exports declined. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Jerome H Powell; Daniel K Tarullo; and John C Williams."
Russia,2015-04-30,"On 30 April 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 14.00 to 12.50 percent per annum, taking account of lower inflation risks and persistent risks of considerable economy cooling. Amid ruble appreciation and significant contraction in consumer demand in February-April 2015, monthly consumer price growth declines and annual inflation tends to stabilise. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, consumer price growth will slow down faster than expected. Annual inflation will fall to less than 8% in a year (April 2016 on April 2015) and to the target of 4% in 2017. As inflation risks abate further, the Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate. According to Bank of Russia estimates, as of 27 April, annual consumer price growth rate stood at 16.5%. High rates of annual inflation are conditioned primarily by short-term factors: ruble depreciation in late 2014 — January 2015 and external trade restrictions. Meanwhile, monthly consumer price growth is estimated to have declined on the average to 1.0% in March-April from 3.1% in January-February, and annual inflation tends to stabilise. Lower consumer demand amid contracting real income and ruble appreciation in the recent months curbed prices. Inflation expectations of the population decreased against this backdrop. Current monetary conditions also facilitate the slowdown in consumer price growth. Money supply (M2) growth rate remains low. Lending and deposit rates are adjusted downwards under the influence of previous Bank of Russia decisions to reduce the key rate. However, they remain high, on the one hand, contributing to attractiveness of ruble savings, and, on the other hand, alongside with tighter borrower and collateral requirements, resulting in lower annual lending growth. The dynamics of the major macroeconomic indicators show a considerable GDP contraction in 2015 Q1. Though structural factors continue hampering the economic growth, output contraction is currently mostly of cyclical nature. It is attested, among other things, by the on-going decline in production capacity and labour force utilisation, and a certain rise in the unemployment rate. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the labour market adjusts to the new conditions mostly through wage decrease and part-time employment. These factors, alongside with a decrease in retail lending, will result in further decline in consumer activity. Fixed capital investments will continue to contract due to persistently high economic uncertainty, deterioration of companies' financial performance, tighter lending conditions, limited ability to replace foreign sources of funding with domestic ones given shallow Russian financial market, as well as high prices for imported investment goods. Sluggish domestic demand will contain imports. Net exports will be the only factor to make a positive contribution to the output growth. These factors will lead to a fall in GDP in 2015. Later on, as import substitution expands, sources of funding gradually diversify, lending conditions ease, and oil prices rise to some extent, the quarter-on-quarter GDP growth is expected to recover. Thus, the current economic conditions will contribute to inflation decline. The ruble appreciation will have additional restraining influence on consumer prices. Inflation, both monthly and annual, is expected to gradually decline. A slowdown in consumer price growth will make room for inflation expectations decrease. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, annual inflation will slow down to less than 8% in a year and to the target of 4% in 2017. Inflation risks emanate primarily from persistently high inflation expectations, aggravation of external economic situation, revision of planned increases in administered prices and tariffs, fiscal policy easing, and accelerated growth in nominal wages, including those in the public sector. As inflation risks abate further, the Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 15 June 2015. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30. Moscow time.

Georgia,2015-05-06,"06.05.15 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 0.5 Percentage Points to 5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 6, 2015 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 5 percent. At the same time the interest rate for the standing refinancing loans increases to policy rate plus 150 basis points. Due to GEL depreciation the inflation expectations have risen, which can be reflected in the risks of the inflation deviating from its target level in the medium term. Given the aforementioned the Monetary Policy Committee considers necessary to increase the monetary policy rate gradually to 5.5 percent by the end of the year. Annual inflation in April was 2.5%. The impact on the inflation of the increase in intermediate costs related to the service of foreign currency-denominated debts (due to the GEL depreciation) was partially balanced by the decrease in fuel prices. The deterioration in economic trends in our main trade partners continues to affect negatively Georgian economy. Goods export, remittances and tourism inflows have all decreased. However the recent changes in the exchange rate have already started to affect the import demand, which in turn ensures the adjustment of external imbalance and fosters domestic demand. According to preliminary information the economic activity in the first quarter was higher than forecast. Despite that, the loan growth has significantly slowed down in April. According to current forecast the inflation will grow at a moderate speed and will reach its 5% target value by the end of 2015. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on July 1, 2015."
Poland,2015-05-06,"Warsaw, 6 May 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 May 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate 1.75% on an annual basis. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate, with a slight acceleration expected in 2015. In the euro area economic growth remains relatively low, although incoming information signals a gradual improvement of economic conditions. In the United States, despite the weakening of GDP growth in 2015 Q1, the recovery is expected to continue. In turn, the economic outlook for Poland's eastern trading partners, i.e. Russia and Ukraine, remains unfavourable. After a sharp and long-lasting fall, global oil prices have risen slightly recently. This has weakened disinflationary forces in many countries. However, global price growth remains very low, and in many European economies it is negative. In these conditions, major central banks are keeping interest rates close to zero and the ECB is continuing its asset purchase programme, which is contributing to higher financial asset prices in many European countries. In Poland, economic activity remains stable, with GDP growth in 2015 Q1 probably slightly higher than in 2014 Q4. Rising domestic demand fuelled by an improving labour market situation, good financial condition of enterprises and stable expansion in lending, remains the main driver of economic growth. In turn, the low, although accelerating, growth in demand from Poland's main trading partners drags down economic activity in Poland. Due to the moderate growth in demand and the continuing negative output gap, there is no demand pressure in the economy. At the same time, low commodity prices and moderate nominal wage growth are contributing to the continued lack of cost pressure. As a result, the annual growth rate of consumer and producer prices remains negative, and inflation expectations are very low. In the opinion of the Council, the annual price growth will remain negative in the coming quarters, mainly due to the previously observed sharp fall in commodity prices. At the same time, the expected gradual acceleration of economic growth, amidst recovery in the euro area and good situation in the domestic labour market, reduce the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged."
Romania,2015-05-06,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference on 8 May 2015. The latest statistical data point to the annual inflation rate remaining below the lower bound of the variation band of the target, amid the further slow annual dynamics of volatile prices and subdued euro area inflation, the persistence of a negative output gap, further low prices on international markets, and the consolidation of inflation expectations within a lower range. In March 2015, the annual inflation rate ran at 0.8 percent, a level similar to that in December 2014. The average annual inflation rate dropped to 0.9 percent in March 2015 and the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, slipped to 1.2 percent, from 1.4 percent in December 2014. Domestic currency loans saw their upward path strengthening, also as a result of the steps taken to ease monetary policy: successive rate cuts, narrowing of the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate, and a gradual reduction in minimum reserve requirements ratios. Lending rates on new business fell to historical lows as far as households and non-financial corporations are concerned. The stock of forex loans kept decreasing, against the backdrop of stepped-up operations to remove non-performing loans from credit institutions' balance sheets. The share of leu-denominated loans in total credit to the private sector widened to 45 percent, against 35.6 percent in May 2012, and their staying on an upward trend is likely to push the real annual dynamics of total credit into positive territory. The Romanian economy expanded by 2.8 percent in 2014, thereby making up for the ground lost after the global financial crisis broke out in 2008. In the final quarter of 2014, real GDP grew by 2.7 percent year on year, with all sectors contributing to this performance. The fast pick-up in consumption and the expected rebound in investment pave the way for a consolidation of economic growth in the period ahead. Foreign trade figures are indicative of the current account deficit possibly remaining at sustainable levels over the medium term. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report. Compared to the February 2015 forecast, the new quarterly projection shows a notably lower path of the expected annual inflation rate. The substantial revision of this path stems mainly from incorporating the measure on lowering the VAT rate to 9 percent, from 24 percent previously, for all food items, non-alcoholic beverages and public food services as of 1 June 2015. Under the impact of the VAT rate reduction concerning the above-mentioned goods and services (making up 32 percent of the CPI basket), the annual inflation rate is expected to come in at around nil between June 2015 and May 2016, before re-entering the variation band of the target in the final quarter of next year. The major risks associated with the current projection relate to the lingering uncertainty surrounding external developments, generated by the situation in Greece and in the euro area, by regional geopolitical tensions, and by the divergence between the monetary policy stances of major central banks worldwide. On the domestic front, in view of the need to increase the Romanian economy's capacity to withstand external shocks, concerns relate to the consistent implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix agreed upon with international institutions and to the speedup of structural reforms. Uncertainties also derive from the effects of the envisaged changes to the fiscal framework, as well as from the influence exerted by the characteristics of the agricultural year and by the calendar of administered price adjustments. Based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 1.75 percent per annum from 2.00 percent starting 7 May 2015 and to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Moreover, with a view to mitigating interbank money market rate volatility and consolidating the transmission of the policy rate signal, the NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±1.5 percentage points from ±1.75 percentage points. Thus, starting 7 May 2015, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 3.25 percent, while the deposit facility rate will remain at 0.25 percent per annum. In order to continue the gradual harmonisation of the reserve requirements mechanism with the European Central Bank standards, the NBR Board has decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratio on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 8 percent from 10 percent starting with the 24 May-23 June 2015 maintenance period. The prospects for the inflation rate to drop to around nil in the following three to four quarters cause these monetary policy decisions to foster lending in a manner supportive of sustainable economic growth and, at the same time, to keep real deposit rates in positive territory. The NBR Board reiterates that its decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term, while safeguarding financial stability. Furthermore, the NBR Board considers that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix, the step-up in structural reforms, and maintaining the wage-productivity match, together with sustainable financial intermediation and an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits are pivotal to consolidating the Romanian economy as part of the EU convergence process. The NBR is restating that the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools, amid close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, will ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 8 May 2015. In line with the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 1 July 2015.

Czech Republic,2015-05-07,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate to be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016, i.e. over the entire forecast horizon. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to domestic prices and other nominal variables. The forecast expects both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation to be close to zero in 2015 and then rise to the 2% target in 2016. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the new forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being anti-inflationary. In this situation, the Bank Board stated again that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the second half of 2016. The Czech National Bank remains ready to move the exchange rate commitment if there were to be a long-term increase in deflation pressures capable, among other things, of causing a slump in domestic demand or a systematic decrease in inflation expectations. As regards the assumptions of the forecast regarding the external environment, euro area demand growth is expected to pick up this year and the next. The decline in producer prices, reflecting the recent fall in prices of oil and other energy commodities, should fade at the end of this year. Producer prices will then rise slightly. Consumer price inflation will also rise gradually from very low levels owing to recovering demand. The European Central Bank responded to the subdued inflation by further easing monetary policy. This is reflected in the outlook for foreign interest rates, which is close to zero until the end of 2016. The price of Brent crude oil partly reversed its previous decline and the market outlook is for a further slow increase over the monetary policy horizon. Compared to the previous forecast, this outlook has been revised slightly upwards over the entire horizon. The impact of the rising oil price on koruna prices of energy will be amplified by a weaker outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate, reflecting the unconventional monetary policy of the European Central Bank. Koruna prices of oil will thus continue to fall markedly year on year in 2015. This represents a favourable supply-side shock from the point of view of the Czech economy, although to a rather smaller extent compared with the previous forecast. Headline inflation was close to zero, i.e. well below the lower boundary of the tolerance band around the Czech National Bank's target, at the start of this year. This was due mainly to the drop in global oil prices, deflation in the euro area and a decline in food prices. The forecast expects inflation to remain close to zero in the second half of this year because of a marked decline in administered prices, which will gradually reflect the fall in energy commodity prices on global markets, and a continuing year-on-year decrease in fuel prices. Next year, inflation will rise to the 2% target as the year-on-year fall in energy commodity prices and the deflationary tendencies in the euro area dissipate. In addition, growing domestic economic activity and accelerating wage growth will foster higher inflation over the entire forecast horizon. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will be only slightly lower than headline inflation. At the end of 2016, it will be slightly below the 2% inflation target. The growth rate of the Czech economy slowed temporarily at the end of 2014. However. GDP growth will start to accelerate again this year, owing to easy domestic monetary conditions, recovering external demand, low oil prices and rising government investment. GDP will grow by 2.6% this year. In 2016, economic growth will exceed 3%. The favourable economic developments will also be reflected in a further improvement in the labour market situation. The number of employees converted into full-time equivalents will continue to rise and the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons will decrease further. Wage growth in the business sector will increase and wages in the non-business sector will rise rapidly, especially this year. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate to be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016, i.e. over the entire forecast horizon. Compared to the previous forecast, the prediction for both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation is slightly higher this year and slightly lower next year. This is due to a more moderate decline in administered prices and fuel prices this year, whereas next year administered prices will rise at a slightly slower pace. A slightly stronger external demand outlook has led to a moderate upward revision of GDP growth next year. The assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016 is unchanged."
Malaysia,2015-05-07,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economic expansion remains moderate, with divergent growth momentum across economies in the first quarter of 2015. While there have been improvements in the advanced economies, the pace of recovery has continued at a modest and uneven pace. For the emerging economies, while growth is slower, the economies continue to be the key contributor to global growth. In most of Asia, growth has been sustained by the continued expansion in domestic demand. Going forward, global economic growth is expected to improve although at a moderate pace. Downside risks to this outlook, however, continue to persist. In this environment, the international financial markets will continue to be affected by shifts in global liquidity and investors sentiments. For Malaysia, latest indicators suggest that domestic demand has continued to support growth in the first quarter. Looking ahead, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand remaining as the key driver of growth. Although private consumption is expected to moderate as households adjust to the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consumption expenditure will be supported by the steady rise in incomes and employment. Investment activity is expected to be led by capital spending in the export-oriented industries, the services sector and for infrastructure projects. These investments will cushion the impact of the lower oil and gas-related investment activity. On the external front, while export growth will be affected by lower commodity prices, manufactured exports will continue to benefit from the improvement in economic activity in several advanced economies and the sustained growth in Asia. Headline inflation averaged at 0.7% in the first quarter of 2015 due to lower domestic fuel prices. For the rest of the year, headline inflation is expected to trend higher given the impact of the implementation of the GST. This is expected to be partially offset by the overall lower global commodity and energy prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid the stable domestic demand conditions. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to carefully assess external and domestic developments and their implications on the risks to inflation and the Malaysian economy. While the risks of destabilising financial imbalances are contained, the MPC will continue to monitor these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. Bank Negara Malaysia 07 May 2015."
Philippines,2015-05-13,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that current monetary policy settings remain appropriate given a manageable inflation environment. Latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that inflation is likely to settle within the lower half of the target range of3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2015-2016, while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored given the recent string of inflation outturns. The Monetary Board likewise observed that the risks to the inflation outlook continue to be broadly balanced, with upside risks emanating from pending petitions for adjustments in electricity rates and possible power shortages. Meanwhile, downside risks remain for global growth, even as prospects have become more evenly balanced. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that domestic demand conditions remain robust, owing to solid private demand and buoyant business sentiment. In the months ahead, ample domestic liquidity and higher public spending are expected to support domestic economic activity and sustain the economy's momentum. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings are appropriately calibrated to the outlook for inflation and domestic economic activity. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor domestic and external developments to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains in line with maintaining price and financial stability."
Chile,2015-05-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 May 2015 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, the world growth economic outlook did not experience significant changes, although the data for the first quarter were weaker than expected. In Latin America, the outlook has deteriorated further. During the month, long-term rates rose in most countries, although they remain at low levels. Sovereign risk premia had mixed movements. In general, currencies depreciated against the dollar, with a noticeable appreciation of the euro. With the exception of food, commodity prices rose, including copper and oil. Data from the first quarter showed that activity and demand grew at a moderate pace. Some recent economic indicators suggest lower dynamism. The growth rate of employment and of the labor force remain subdued, while the unemployment rate was unchanged. Nominal wages kept their annual expansion rate. In April, headline inflation was higher than forecasted, which was not the case for core inflation. Both measures still show high annual levels. Its evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. Medium-term inflation expectations remain at 3%. Local financial conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2015-05-15,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, while the trend of economic recovery in the US has shown signs of temporarily slowing, improvements in the euro area have continued. In emerging market countries including China the trends of slowing growth have continued. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, and by uncertainties over the restructuring of Greek debt. Looking at the Korean economy, although exports have continued their trend of decline and domestic demand-related indicators have fluctuated from month to month, the sentiments of economic agents have improved. On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio has fallen as the number of persons employed in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector has decreased, but the unemployment rate has maintained the same level as that during April of last year. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will show a modest trend of recovery going forward, although the negative output gap will persist for a considerable time. Despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural and petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation registered 0.4% in April, the same as in March, as the rate of increase in prices of industrial products slowed. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 2.0%, from 2.1% in March. Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen, owing largely to sharp rises in interest rates in major countries and to increased issuance of bonds. Stock prices have also risen, chiefly on net purchases of domestic stocks by foreigners. The Korean won had appreciated against the US dollar, due mainly to the possibility of a delay in the policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and to inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds, but has since depreciated. The won has shown similar movements against the Japanese yen. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as international oil prices and shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as developments related to the spare capacity in the domestic economy and the trends of household debt and capital flows."
Peru,2015-05-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2015 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the 2.0 percent target in the 2015-2016 forecast horizon and takes into account that: economic activity continues showing levels below its potential level; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range; international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as high volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets, and domestic inflation has been affected by temporary supply-side factors, which will reverse gradually. Inflation in April showed a rate of 0.39 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation remained at 3.02 percent in April. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of meals outside the home (0.5 percent), fish (7.5 percent), and tomatoes (24.2 percent). Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.34 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 2.58 percent in March to 2.74 percent in April. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations continue showing a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels. In May, the Central Bank has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 7.5 to 7.0 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and stands ready to make changes in its monetary policy instruments if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.00 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on June 11, 2015."
Turkiye,2015-05-20," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The ongoing cautious monetary policy along with prudent fiscal and macroprudential policies continue to have a favorable impact on inflation, especially inflation excluding energy and food (core inflation indicators). However, recently elevated volatility in the exchange rates has limited the improvement in the core inflation, as stated in the Inflation Report. This, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2015-05-21,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 21 May 2015 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The challenges facing monetary policy have persisted, and, as expected, the downward trend in inflation which was mainly attributable to the impact of lower oil prices, has reversed. Headline inflation is expected to breach temporarily the upper end of the target range early next year, and thereafter remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target band for most of the forecast period. The upside risks have increased, mainly due to further possible electricity price increases. The exchange rate also continues to impart an upside risk to inflation as uncertainty regarding impending US monetary policy continues. Domestic demand, however, remains subdued while electricity constraints continue to weigh on output growth and general consumer and business confidence. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,0 per cent and 4,5 per cent in March and April respectively. The petrol price increase of R1,56 per litre in April resulted in a decline in the rate of disinflation from the transport category, from -5,0 per cent in March to -1,1 per cent 1. The petrol price increase of R1,56 per litre in April resulted in a decline in the rate of disinflation from the transport category, from -5,0 per cent in March to -1,1 per cent 1 in April, while food price inflation moderated further. The main contributions to the April headline rate came from the categories of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services, which together accounted for 3,2 percentage points of the outcome. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, moderated from 5,7 per cent in March to 5,6 per cent in April. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods appears to have reached a low point in February at 2,6 per cent, following the 3,1 per cent outcome in March, higher than market consensus. While food price inflation moderated, the main upside contribution came from coal and petroleum products where disinflation slowed. The recent increase in international oil prices and higher agricultural crop prices, along with further electricity price increases from mid-year are likely to sustain the upward momentum. The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is now expected to average 4,9 per cent in 2015, with a first quarter low of 4,1 per cent. A temporary breach of the upper end of the inflation target band is still expected during the first quarter of 2016, to peak at 6,8 per cent, and to decline to 6,0 per cent by the second quarter of that year. An average inflation rate of 6,1 per cent is forecast for the year. The forecast period has now been extended to the end of 2017, with an average inflation rate of 5,7 per cent expected for the year, and 5,6 per cent in the final quarter. 2 The forecast for core inflation has also increased marginally, to 5,6 per cent in 2015, and to 5,4 per cent in 2016. Core inflation is expected to average 5,2 per cent in 2017, with a final quarter average of 5,1 per cent. Much of the persistence of core inflation at these levels is attributed to high levels of wage growth, currency depreciation and inflation expectations entrenched at the upper end of the target range. The headline inflation forecast assumes electricity price increases of 13,0 per cent from July 2015 and July 2016 in line with the original multi-year price determination process of Nersa. However, the application by Eskom for a further 12,6 per cent increase from 1 July 2015 will be decided at the end of June. Given the uncertainty regarding this decision, both in terms of quantum and timing of implementation, it has not been incorporated into the forecast, but poses a significant upside risk. Should Nersa fully accede to the Eskom request, a higher peak of headline inflation as well as a more extended breach of the target can be expected. The direct and indirect effects of such an increase could increase average inflation by around 0,5 percentage points over a year. The BER inflation expectations survey for the second quarter of 2015 will only be released in June. Median inflation expectations as reflected in the Reuters Econometer poll, at 4,9 per cent and 5,9 per cent for 2015 and 2016, are similar to the Bank's forecast, although there is a fairly wide dispersion between respondents. The break-even inflation rates, as reflected in the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds, have been more volatile, and are 3. The break-even inflation rates, as reflected in the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds, have been more volatile, and are 3 above the upper end of the target range over all maturities, having reversed their earlier declines this year. The outlook for the global economy is broadly unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The US growth forecast for 2015 has been revised down by about half a percentage point following the broad-based first quarter estimate of 0,2 per cent, although this deterioration is generally believed to be temporary. Growth of around 3,0 per cent is now expected in 2015, still above estimated potential. Eurozone growth has surprised on the upside, and while still relatively subdued at an expected 1,5 per cent for 2015, there are indications that the region is responding to the ECB monetary stimulus. Any possible fall-out from the debt crisis in Greece remains uncertain. Japan is expected to growth by just below one per cent this year. Growth in some of the larger emerging markets remains weak. Negative growth is being experienced in Brazil and Russia, and although the Chinese economy is still slowing, with first quarter growth of around 5,3 per cent, a hard landing is not expected amid further monetary policy easing. By contrast, the Indian economy has been performing strongly, partly in response to policy reforms. While growth in Africa has remained relatively robust, downside risks have emerged in some of the oil and commodity-producing countries. Global inflation remains benign, but the partial recovery in the international oil price has ameliorated the deflationary risks in some of the advanced economies in particular. Higher, but still low, inflation expectations contributed to a sharp rise in bond yields in some of the advanced economies, with spillovers to other bond 4. Higher, but still low, inflation expectations contributed to a sharp rise in bond yields in some of the advanced economies, with spillovers to other bond 4 markets. However, most central banks remain in loosening mode, with further reductions in policy interest rates in a number of countries since the previous meeting of the MPC. A notable exception has been Brazil, where monetary policy was tightened for the third time this year. Global financial markets remain focused on the timing of US monetary policy tightening. Low inflation and the weaker first quarter growth outcome have pushed out expectations regarding the starting date, but financial markets generally expect the first move to be during 2015, most likely in September, followed by a gradual data dependent tightening cycle. Continued financial market volatility is likely to ensue with each relevant data release. The uncertainty regarding US growth prospects contributed to a weakening of the dollar against most currencies in recent weeks. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand traded in a relatively narrow band of between R11,80 and R12,20 against the US dollar, and is currently almost unchanged since then. However, in line with dollar weakening, the rand has depreciated by 0,6 per cent against the euro and by 4,0 per cent against the pound sterling. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by 0,3 per cent. The rand continues to be vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of global risk perceptions and associated capital flows, particularly in response to anticipated changes to US monetary policy. At the same time, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the extent to which US monetary policy normalisation has been priced into the rand. However, past patterns suggest that some further pressure is likely on the exchange 5. However, past patterns suggest that some further pressure is likely on the exchange 5 rate and long bond yields as the start of the US tightening cycle becomes more certain. Reflecting this uncertainty, non-resident bond and equity flows have been quite volatile. According to JSE data, non-residents have been net buyers of bonds and equities to the value of around R15 billion since the beginning of this year. The rand therefore remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook, although the degree of upside risk is tempered somewhat by the continued relatively low level of pass-through to consumer price inflation. The Bank estimates that the actual pass- through could be about half of what is currently implied in the forecast model, but it is still uncertain as to whether this reflects a permanent change or a temporary phenomenon which can reverse rapidly. The domestic growth outlook remains weak, amid continued electricity supply constraints and low and declining levels of business and consumer confidence. The Bank's forecast for GDP growth is marginally down from the previous forecast: growth is expected to average 2,1 per cent and 2,2 per cent in 2015 and 2016, and to increase to 2,7 per cent in 2017. Growth for the next two years therefore is expected to be more or less in line with our estimate of short-term potential output growth of between 2,0 and 2,5 per cent. It also suggests that the negative output gap, currently estimated at around 1,5 per cent, is likely to persist. This forecast makes an assumption regarding the persistence of electricity shortages, which are expected to be relieved somewhat only in 2017. However, the risks to growth are assessed to be on the downside. The moderate decline in the Bank's composite leading business cycle indicator also suggests a continuation of the sluggish growth outlook. 6 Despite a strong performance by the mining sector in March, first quarter growth is expected to be subdued and much lower than the 4,1 per cent measured in the fourth quarter of 2014. According to Statistics South Africa, the physical volume of mining output increased at a quarter-to-quarter rate of 1,9 per cent in the first quarter. Platinum group metals output was particularly strong in March with a month- on-month increase of 26,6 per cent. By contrast, manufacturing output appears to have contracted by about 0,6 per cent in the quarter, consistent with the continued decline in the Kagiso PMI, down to 45,4 index points in April, and the slight decline in capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector. The real value of building plans passed declined for a fourth successive month in February, in line with a weaker FNB/BER Building Confidence index in the first quarter of the year. Consumption expenditure by households is expected to remain relatively subdued, as higher personal tax rates take effect and the benefits of lower petrol prices dissipate. There are mixed signals from the retail trade sales which rebounded strongly in February but then contracted in March on a month-on-month basis. A quarterly growth rate of 0,9 per cent was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. Growth in expenditure on durable goods in particular is expected to decline, as reflected in the sluggish new vehicle sales, which decreased further in April. The FNB/BER consumer confidence index declined sharply in the first quarter of 2015, signalling modest growth in consumption expenditure going forward. Subdued levels of household consumption expenditure are reflected in credit extension by banks to households, where the divergence between households and 7. Subdued levels of household consumption expenditure are reflected in credit extension by banks to households, where the divergence between households and 7 corporates continues. Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector was 13,9 per cent in March 2015, compared with 3,6 per cent to households. The latter is reflective of continued weak growth across all the main categories of credit, influenced by both supply and demand factors. These trends are likely to be reinforced further by the implementation of affordability assessment regulations as part of revisions to the National Credit Regulations in March. The impending changes in the Basel III regulatory requirements are also contributing to relatively tight credit conditions. At the same time, weak employment growth, high debt levels and continued household deleveraging, as well as expectations of higher interest rates may have impacted on the demand for credit. Trends in remuneration growth remain a concern to the MPC. Average wage and salary growth has been in excess of inflation for some time, imparting some degree of automatic indexation to wage settlements, and therefore maintaining higher levels of inflation. In the fourth quarter of 2014, year-on-year growth in nominal remuneration per worker in the non-agricultural formal sector increased by 7,7 per cent. Once accounting for labour productivity growth of 1,3 per cent, unit labour costs showed an increase of 6,3 per cent, from 5,7 per cent in the previous quarter. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements measured 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. The public sector wage settlement appears to have been settled at an increase of 7 per cent, but the full impact on the total government wage bill is still unclear. Upside risks to inflation from wage pressures are still expected, with the unresolved settlements in the coal and gold mining sectors of particular concern. 8 While high wage settlements could underpin household consumption expenditure, this could be offset in part by inevitable reductions in employment. Food price inflation is expected to contribute to upside inflation pressures. This is despite the continued moderation of global food prices and a recent declining trend of food price inflation at the CPI level and lower meat price inflation at the producer price level. Food price inflation measured 5,0 per cent in April following eight successive months of moderation. Similarly, final manufactured food producer price inflation moderated to 5,8 per cent in March. However, domestic drought conditions have resulted in a need to import yellow maize, contributing to maize prices rising close to import parity levels. These pressures, along with the weaker exchange rate, are expected to reverse the favourable trend in food price inflation by the second half of this year. The international oil price appears to have stabilised in the US$60-US$70 per barrel range, as capital expenditure plans have been scaled back following the collapse of prices in the later part of last year. Since the previous meeting of the MPC. Brent crude oil prices have increased by about US$10 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices remained unchanged in May, but a further increase of around 50 cents per litre, should current trends persist, is likely in June, attributable mainly to higher international product prices. 9 Although the upward revision of the inflation forecast was relatively small, the persistence of medium term inflation at elevated levels and the deteriorating risks to the outlook are an increasing concern to the MPC. While currently the breach is expected to be temporary, the longer term trajectory is close to the upper end of the target range, and the upside risks make this trajectory vulnerable to any significant changes in inflation pressures. The main risks to the outlook remain electricity tariff increases, the exchange rate and wage settlements. Significant additional electricity tariff increases are likely to cause inflation to diverge significantly from the target range for a more extended period than our baseline forecast suggests. The rand remains vulnerable to global market reaction to US policy normalisation, particularly in the context of South Africa's twin deficits. Any significant weakening of the exchange rate in reaction to US monetary policy tightening could cause inflation to diverge even further from target, and set in motion an exchange rate-inflation spiral. Furthermore, the possibility of a wage-price spiral, should settlements well in excess of inflation become an economy-wide norm, also poses a risk to the outlook. The MPC recognises that domestic inflation is not driven by demand factors that are more easily dealt with through monetary policy responses. Household consumption expenditure remains relatively subdued. While monetary policy should generally look through supply side shocks, such as large electricity tariff increases and oil price changes, we have to be mindful of the second-round effects of such shocks. In particular, we need to monitor closely the possible impact on inflation expectations 10. In particular, we need to monitor closely the possible impact on inflation expectations 10 which remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range over the longer term. Growth remains fragile, constrained by electricity shortages and low business confidence and the risk to the outlook remain on the downside. But this cannot be solved by monetary policy alone. Monetary policy action will need to achieve a fine balance between achieving our primary mandate of price stability and not undermining growth unduly. The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at this meeting. Four members of the committee favoured an unchanged stance while two favoured a 25 basis point increase. The deteriorating inflation outlook suggests that this unchanged stance cannot be maintained indefinitely. The MPC will continue to closely monitor the evolution of inflation expectations and other factors that could undermine the longer term inflation outlook and stands ready to act when appropriate. From the next meeting in July the Bank will take further steps to increase transparency by publishing the assumptions underlying the Bank's forecast with the MPC statement.

Pakistan,2015-05-23,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 23, 2015 Macroeconomic conditions towards the end of FY15 have further improved compared to the beginning of the fiscal year. Current account deficit has narrowed down; average annual inflation is significantly below the target; there is marginal uptick in real GDP growth; and foreign exchange reserve buildup continues. All these developments were reflected in the recent upgrades in outlook by international rating agencies that have further improved investor confidence. The current macroeconomic stability achieved through domestic policies and favorable external developments provide an opportunity to focus on reforms that will put the economy on sustainable growth path. With contraction in imports, led by sharp decline in oil prices, and strong growth in remittances, the external current account deficit at $1. billion during Jul-Apr FY15 is around half of the deficit recorded in the corresponding period of last year. The improvement has overshadowed lower surplus in capital and financial account, especially weak foreign private investment. Overall this has supported the reserve building efforts with net SBP reserves rising from $9. billion as of 30th June 2014 to $12. billion as of 15th May 2015. They are expected to increase further due to subdued outlook of international oil prices, successful continuation of IMF program, and realization of expected official foreign inflows. Increase in foreign private inflows can further strengthen this outlook and sustain stability in the foreign exchange market. The inflation continues with its downward trajectory in this fiscal year. The year-on-year CPI inflation has declined to. percent in April 2015 from. percent in June 2014. The decline in inflation during the current fiscal year has been broad based as all the headline and underlying measures of inflation have recorded deceleration. Soft international commodity prices, stability in exchange rate, contained government borrowings from SBP, moderate aggregate demand, and SBP's earlier conservative monetary policy stance have remained the key factors in controlling inflation this year. Going forward, continuation of inflation at lower levels is reflected in the latest IBA-SBP survey of May 2015 that reports subdued inflation expectations. However uncertainty about international oil prices and possible adjustment in domestic energy prices are the main risks to this inflation outlook. Credit growth during Jul-Mar FY15 has remained well diversified in terms of coverage and type of finance. All three sectors of the economy agriculture, manufacturing and services availed credit both for working capital and for fixed investment purposes. The highlight remains the loans to private sector businesses in fixed investment category that increased to Rs84. billion in Jul-Mar FY15 from Rs50. billion in the same period of last year. However owing largely to decrease in commodity prices, loans in the working capital category dropped to Rs90. billion Page STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN in Jul-Mar FY15 from Rs223. billion in the same period of FY14. Improving investor confidence, buoyant construction activity, continuous stability of the banking system, and the recent monetary easing are expected to positively impact credit uptake in the coming months. Broad money (M2) has expanded by. percent during July 01-May 08. FY15 against. percent during the same period last year. Importantly the contribution of Net Foreign Assets in the expansion of M2 continues to remain substantial. This has favorably impacted the Net Domestic Assets-to-Net Foreign Assets ratio. The favorable improvement in this ratio is expected to continue with the availability of anticipated external flows. M2 is likely to grow within the safe limits; consistent with the inflationary outlook. After remaining tight during most of the current fiscal year, liquidity conditions at the back of overall improvement in balance of payments have relatively eased towards the end of FY15. The money market overnight repo rate, on average, remained 49 basis points below the SBP's policy rate in the post March 2015 monetary policy decision compared to 3 basis points in the post January 2015 decision. These developments bode well for the smooth transmission of policy rate changes to other market interest rates in addition to the implementation of the revised interest rate corridor framework. In line with monetary policy stance, market interest rates have fallen since January 2015. With current trends in key macroeconomic variables, money market liquidity is expected to remain at ease in the coming months. Real GDP is provisionally estimated to have grown by. percent in FY15, slightly higher than. percent in FY14. Overcoming energy shortages and improving law and order conditions is expected to provide further impetus in reviving investment and higher production. Gradual realization of planned investment in energy and infrastructure projects will provide additional boost to growth. Consequently growth is expected to be revived at relatively faster pace going forward. Given the above macroeconomic considerations. SBP Board of Directors has taken the following decisions effective from 25th May 2015:. Ceiling rate of the interest rate corridor is reduced by 100 basis points from. percent to. percent. new “SBP target rate” is set at 50 basis points below the ceiling rate. SBP will ensure that the overnight rate remains close to this target rate. This will be the main Policy Rate of SBP. Width of the interest rate corridor is reduced by 50 basis points from 250 to 200 basis points. Consequently the floor rate is set at. percent. Page."
Israel,2015-05-25,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor April increased by 0.6 percent, while forecasters had projected a slightly lower increase of 0.5 percent, on average. There were marked increasesin the fruit and vegetables component and in the clothing and footwear (seasonal increase) component. The rate of inflation as measured by the changein the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.5 percent, compared to negative 1 percent over the 12 months that ended in March. Following a cumulative decline of 1.8 percent in the CPI in November-February, the Index increased by 0.9 percent, cumulative, over the past two months, despite a slight decline in the housing component in April. This has occurred inter alia against the background of a change in the trend of energy prices, which contributed 0.8 percent to the decline in the CPI over the past 12 months. The CPI excluding housing declined by 1.3 percent in the past year. CPI components representing tradable goods declined by 1.6 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a decline of 2.4 percent in the 12 monthsthat ended in March, while components representing nontradable items increased by 0.2 percent, compared to a decline of 0.1 percent in the 12 months that ended in March. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One-year inflation expectations from various sources are around the lower bound of the inflation target range. Private forecasters' projectionsfor the next 12 CPI readings are 1 percent, on average, compared with 1.1 percent in the previous month, and expectations derived from banks'internal interest rates are 0.8 percent, compared to 0.6 percent last month. Twelve-month ahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market are currently 1.1 percent, and expectations for two years are 1.35 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) forward expectations increased to 1.65 percent this month, while expectations for longer terms (5-10 years)continue to range around the midpoint of the inflation target range. Similar to last month, most private forecasters do not expect a reduction in theBank of Israel interest rate in the next few months; however, the Telbor curve continues to point to some probability of such a reduction. Real economic activity: Indicators of activity for the first quarter of 2015 and for the month of April continue topoint to the economy growing at the moderate rate that has prevailed in the past two years. According to the first estimate of National Accounts datafor the first quarter (seasonally adjusted data in annual terms). GDP grewby 2.5 percent, and business sector product increased by 3.2 percent. Growth was led by an increase of 6.5 percent in private consumption (excluding durable goods) and an increase of 9.4 percent in exports (excluding diamonds and startups). In contrast, fixed capital formation contracted by 7.4 percent, and durable goods consumption declined by 11.2 percent. Some of the decline is the result of a sharp decrease in vehicle imports, following a steep increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds and defense imports) increased by 9 percent. According to foreign trade data, goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds) declined in April (in current dollar terms) by 4.3 percent, further to adecline of 4.7 percent in the first quarter, and business services exports (excluding startup companies) remained unchanged in February. The number of tourist arrivals and overnight stays remained significantly lower than in the first half of 2014. Following several months of relatively high growth, the Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in April, led by growth in indices of industrial production and of trade revenue (in March). The business sector climate index continues to indicate that themonthly rate of growth has stabilized at 0.22-0.24 percent. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics has increased sharply in recent months, and the index compiled by Bank Hapoalim is stable at a relatively high level. The Purchasing Managers Index continues to range around 50 points, declining to 49.2 this month. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for the first quarter among 25-64 year olds (the principal working ages) indicate that the unemployment rate continued to decline slightly (to 4.8 percent, compared with 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014), but this occurred against the background of a decline in the participation rate (79.5 percent compared to 79.7 percent) and in the employment rate (75.7 percent compared to 75.8 percent). April data indicate an improvement in the unemployment rate as well as in the participation and employment rates.Survey data and employee post figures indicate an increase in employment in public services, compared to stability or decline in the business sector.Nominal wages increased by 1.0 percent, and real wages by 1.1 percent, in December-February, relative to September-November (seasonally adjusted data). The first part of the increase in the minimum wage was implemented in April: from NIS 4,300 per month to NIS 4,650 per month, and was reflected in an increase in health tax receipts in April. Receipts were about 5.9 percent higher (in nominal terms) in February-April than in the corresponding period one year ago. Budget data: In January-April, the domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was aboutNIS 3.1 billion. NIS 1.7 billion greater than the seasonal path consistentwith achieving the deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP, mainly as a result of the fact that expenditures are based on a transition budget. Since thebeginning of the year tax revenues have increased by 7.8 percent, in real terms, compared with January-April of last year, and are about NIS 1.7 billion higher than the seasonal path. With that, nontax revenue is about NIS 1.9 billion lower than the seasonal path. Gross domestic VAT revenues increased by about 10 percent in real terms, compared with the corresponding period in 2014. Total domestic expenditure (excluding credit) in January-April was about NIS 2 billion lower than the seasonal path that is consistent with the expenditure rule. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on April 26, 2015, through May 22, 2015, the shekel strengthened by about 1.3 percent against the dollar, and weakened by about 1.3 percent against the euro. The shekel was stable in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on April 26, 2015, throughMay 21, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 1.2 percent. There was a sharp correction in the government bond market, and yields on both the nominal and CPI-indexed curves increased by up to 60 basis points; the curves steepened, similar to the global trend. The yield on unindexed bonds with 9 years to maturity increased from about 1.4 percent to around 1.8 percent. There were slight changes along the makam yield curve, and mostof the curve was trading at a yield lower than the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained virtually unchanged, at about 71 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in April, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 50.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.0 percent. During May, thepace of net withdrawals from money market funds continued to moderate. The credit market: In March, the outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 4 billion (0.5 percent) to around NIS 821 billion. With that, there was relatively high growth in outstanding credit during the first quarter, compared with the end of 2014, mainly the result of an increase in direct loans from institutional investors and, to a lesser extent, the result of an increase in bank credit and in credit from abroad. In April, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 1.1 billion in bonds, lower than the monthly average over the preceding 12 months of NIS 2.9 billion. There were net withdrawals from corporate bond mutual funds in April, totaling about NIS 0.2 billion, while therewas net new investment of NIS 2.6 billion in general bond funds. Corporatebond market spreads increased slightly in April, following a decline in the previous two months. Outstanding household debt increased in March by NIS 3.3 billion (0.8 percent), of which NIS 0.4 billion (0.1 percent) wasin housing debt. Despite the holidays, new mortgage volume was NIS 4.7 billion in April. The decline in the share of mortgages extended to buyers purchasing a home as an investment was halted, and the share of fixed-rate mortgages taken out continued to increase. Mortgage interest rates declined onmost indexation bases this month: by 0.05 percentage points in the CPI-indexed fixed rate track, by 0.07 percentage points in the unindexed fixed rate track, and by 0.03 percentage points in the unindexed variable rate track. The interest rate in the CPI-indexed variable rate track remained unchanged. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.1 percent in April,and has increased by 2.1 percent over the past 12 months. In February-March, home prices increased by 0.4 percent, and in the 12 months ending in March, they increased by 3.8 percent, similar to the previous month's rate. Nonetheless, in the past half year their rate of growth returned to the one that prevailed before the period of waiting for the outcome of the zero VAT plan. In March, too, new homes were sold at an elevated rate. However, preliminary data indicate that the number of overall housingtransactions continued to decline for all buyer categories, and the numberof transactions by investors is similar to the average in recent years. The number of new homes available for sale was stable in the past four months, after declining in previous months. In the 12 months ending in February, there were about 43,200 building starts and about 44,800 building completions. The global economy: Global economic indicators continue to point to moderate activity. First quarter US National Accounts data indicating that GDP grew by only 0.2 percent (in annual terms) disappointed, and there are assessments that the figure is liable to be revised downward in the second reading. With that, the Federal Reserve noted in its announcement that first quarter growth was impacted on by transitory factors, and therefore it expects continued moderate growth in the coming quarters. This assessment is bolstered by labor market data, which indicate that 220,000 new jobs were added to nonfarm payrolls in April. In contrast,industrial production declined for the fifth consecutive quarter. There was generally no change in assessments regarding the date when the federal funds rate will begin to be increased in the US, and the uncertainty about the liftoff continues. In Europe, there were further indicators that pointed to the moderate recovery continuing, and first quarter GDP grew, as expected, by a quarterly rate of 0.4 percent. Estimates based on company surveys weakened this month, after a solid increase in recent months, but they continue to point to a positive trend. Weakness was also seen in the most recent data on unemployment, industrial production, and retail sales. These results sharpened the assessment that the recovery is still not entrenched. Following several negative readings, the eurozone CPI remained unchanged in April, and there was an increase in inflation expectations, against the background of higher energy prices and improvement in domestic demand. The crisisin Greece continues, and remains a significant risk to Europe's economy. In Japan, inflation remained near zero, excluding the effect of the VAT increase, while first quarter GDP surprised to the upside, though it was primarily due to an increase in inventories. Weakness continues in China,seen in several indicators of real economic activity, and the central bankthere announced an interest rate reduction. Monetary easing measures were adopted this month in several other countries as well. There were declines in most equity and bond markets worldwide. The price of oil remained virtually unchanged by the end of the period, at about $65 per barrel. Prices of commodities excluding energy also remained unchanged. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for June 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The pathof the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: v After several negative readings, the CPI increased in March and April by a cumulative 0.9 percent.Global fuel prices stabilized. One-year inflation expectations from various sources remained around the lower bound of the inflation target range, and expectations for 2 years and for medium terms rose toward the midpoint ofthe target range. v Indicators of real economic activity remain mixed, and point toward continuing growth at the rate that prevailed in the past two years. Business sector product grew in the first quarter by 3.2 percent, and the unemployment rate continued to decline. Tax revenue data indicate continued growth in private consumption. Monthly export data, in dollar terms, point to a contraction in goods exports andto an absence of growth in services exports over recent months. v First quarter GDP growth in the US was lower than expected, but assessments are that it is primarily due to transitory factors. Moderate recovery continues in the eurozone, but the crisis in Greece continues to be a significant risk to the economy.Signs of weakness continue in China's economy. Uncertainty remainsregarding the date of liftoff for the US federal funds rate. v From the monetary policy discussion on April 26, 2015, through May 22, 2015, the shekel strengthened by 1.3 percent against the dollar, and remained stable in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. For the year to date, there has been an effective appreciation of 3.7 percent in the shekel, and continued appreciation is liable to weigh on growth of exports and of the tradable sector. v The increase in home prices continues, and new mortgage volume remains elevated. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. <span dir 3Drtl>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for June 2015 will be published on June 8, 2015.

Hungary,2015-05-26,"At its meeting on 26 May 2015, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 15 basis points from 1.80% to 1.65%, with effect from 27 May 2015. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pick-up in the components of domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, unemployment continues to exceed its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for April, consumer prices show historically low dynamics; however, the rate of decline in prices slowed further. The April inflation data was slightly higher than both the projection in the March issue of the Inflation Report and market expectations; however, the Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the short-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets, subdued imported inflation, the degree of unused capacity in the economy and the moderation in inflation expectations. Rises in fuel prices as well as in the price indices for market services and unprocessed food were the main factors contributing to the increase in inflation. Core inflation was up slightly compared to the previous month. With the pick-up in domestic demand and owing to the increase in wages, core inflation is likely to rise gradually; however, this process may slow due to the second-round effects of low commodity prices. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. Overall, moderate underlying inflation developments continue to point in the direction of a low inflation environment, and therefore inflation is expected to approach levels around 3 per cent towards the end of the forecast period. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue at a rapid pace. Robust growth has been supported by both domestic and external demand. This is underpinned by the preliminary GDP data for the first quarter of 2015, which showed that the Hungarian economy continued to grow dynamically, mainly driven by the performance of industry and the expansion in retail sales. On the expenditure side, domestic demand growth may have continued. According to preliminary data, the trade surplus was higher in March than a year previously. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable and increased slightly in recent months, with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Rising household real income as a result of low inflation, the reduced need for deleveraging and increasing employment are expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pick up gradually, owing to the recovery in activity, the Funding for Growth Scheme and its extension. Employment grew further in the first quarter as activity picked up. International investor sentiment has been mostly unfavourable in the period since the Council's latest interest rate decision. The downgrade of Greek government debt as well as tensions surrounding its financing and weak incoming macroeconomic data from the US negatively affected international investor sentiment. In addition, the reduction in risks associated with deflation in the euro-area economy may also have contributed to rises in long-term yields in developed and emerging markets. Accompanied by noticeable fluctuations, the forint depreciated against the euro, mainly driven by international factors. The domestic CDS spread has remained broadly unchanged, while long-term government bond yields have risen in line with rising euro area yields in the period since the latest policy decision. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there is a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for a sustained period. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually. Based on data becoming available previously, the risk of second-round effects taking hold in the wake of the change in inflation expectations still remains after increasing in recent months. In the Council's judgement, if the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, the inflation outlook and the cyclical position of the economy point in the direction of a reduction in the policy rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Cautious easing of the policy rate may continue as long as it supports the achievement of the medium-term inflation target."
Ukraine,2015-05-28,"On May 27-28, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Ukraine (hereinafter  the Committee) held its regular meeting. The meeting discussed the possible scenarios for future economic and monetary developments and considered the expediency of changing the parameters of monetary instruments. The Committee members pointed to the sustained positive trends in the money market. In April-May, in particular, the impact that the behavioural factor had on the exchange-rate path was significantly limited, amid the gradual appreciation of the hryvnia. Thus, the official UAH/USD exchange rate fluctuated within the range of UAH 21.4  23.5 per USD 1 throughout April, while in May it moved within the range of UAH 20.6  20.8 per USD 1. The public confidence in the banking sector was gradually being restored. In April 2015, the stock of household hryvnia deposits increased by UAH 4.2 billion. At the same time, consumer inflation accelerated sharply (to 60.9% year-on-year in April). The spike in inflation was driven by increases in utility and natural gas tariffs. The high CPI figure was also attributed to peculiarities of the data collection procedure of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The Committee members pointed out that the National Bank of Ukraine should take a forward-looking approach by using the available instruments to provide an adequate response consistent with the projected inflation path, taking into account inflationary expectations of households and businesses, rather than responding to the current inflation rate. After hitting its peak, inflation is expected to slow down considerably over the next 12 months. The Committee members present at the meeting noted the monetary policy should focus on restraining the second-round effects of inflationary shocks that had already materialized. The Committee members raised concerns over the Ukrainian economy sliding into a protracted recession: the annual rate of decline in the index of key sectors output deepened to 23.4% in April 2015. Accordingly, heightened risks remained that the economy would slow down dramatically. Under such macroeconomic conditions, the shared opinion of the Committee members is that the major contribution that monetary policy can make to the economic recovery is to put the money market, notably its foreign exchange segment, back on track. This microfinancial stabilization will help restore an efficient monetary transmission mechanism and enable the banking system to provide lending to the economy to underpin growth, should the National Bank of Ukraine loosen the monetary policy. In view of the above, and given the need to put the money market firmly on the path to stabilization, the Committee members concurred in the expediency of keeping the discount rate at 30%. This level of the discount rate will help ensure a firm downward path of inflation and encourage the return of household deposits to the banking system. As the risks to the hryvnia stability subside, it raises the prospects of the monetary policy stance being loosened in the near future."
India,2015-06-02,"Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2015-16 Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.5 per cent to 7.25 per cent with immediate effect; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 14-day term repos as well as longer term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with overnight/term variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 8.25 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement of 2015-16 issued in April 2015, incoming data suggest that the global recovery is still slow and getting increasingly differentiated across regions. In the United States, the economy shrank in Q1 owing to harsh weather conditions, the strength of the US dollar weighing on exports and a decline in non-residential fixed investment. In the euro area, financial conditions have eased due to the European Central Bank's (ECB) quantitative easing and a depreciating euro. There has, however, been some moderation in composite purchasing managers' indices (PMI), economic sentiment and consumer confidence in April. In Japan, growth surprised on the upside in Q1, supported by private demand as business spending boosted inventories and personal consumption. For most emerging market economies (EMEs), macroeconomic conditions remain challenging due to domestic fragilities, exacerbated by bouts of financial market turbulence. China continues to decelerate in spite of monetary easing. The recent firming up of crude prices has reduced headwinds to growth for some energy exporters, while increasing them for importers. Even absent a decisive economic recovery or adverse geopolitical shocks, oil prices appear to be volatile.2 3. Global financial markets have also been volatile, with risk-on risk-off shifts induced by changing perceptions of monetary policies in the advanced economies. Global currency markets continue to be dominated by the strength of the US dollar, with the G3 currencies reflecting the asynchronicity of their monetary policy stances. Volatility in global bond markets has increased with a number of factors at play: unwinding of European assets by investors due to the Greek crisis; rapidly changing expectations around the Fed's forward guidance; sharp movements in crude prices; and market corrections due to changes in risk tolerance. As anticipated, the Central Statistics Office has revised downwards its estimate of India's gross value added (GVA) at basic prices for 2014-15 by 30 basis points from the advance estimates. Domestic economic activity remains moderate in Q1 of 2015-16. Agricultural activity was adversely affected by unseasonal rains and hailstorms in north India during March 2015, impinging on an estimated 94 lakh hectares of area sown under the rabi crop. Reflecting this, the third advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture indicate a contraction in foodgrains production by more than 5 per cent in relation to the preceding year's level. Successive estimates have been pointing to a worsening of the situation, with the damage to crops like pulses and oilseeds  where buffer foodstocks are not available in the central pool  posing an upside risk to food inflation. For the kharif season, the outlook is clouded by the first estimates of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), predicting that the southwest monsoon will be 7 per cent below the long period average. This has been exacerbated by the confirmation of the onset of El Nino by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. What is clear is that contingency plans for food management, including storage of adequate quantity of seeds and fertilisers for timely supply, crop insurance schemes, credit facilities, timely release of food stocks and the repair of disruptions in food supply chains, including through imports and de-hoarding, need to be in place to manage the impact of low production on inflation. Inflation control will also be helped by limiting the increase in agricultural support prices. Industrial production has been recovering, albeit unevenly. The sustained weakness of consumption spending, especially in rural areas as indicated in the slowdown in sales of two-wheelers and tractors, continues to operate as a drag. Corporate sales have contracted. The disappointing earnings performance could have been worse if not for the decline in input costs. Capacity utilisation has been falling in several industries, indicative of the slack in the economy. While an upturn in capital goods production seems underway, clear evidence of a revival in investment demand will need to build on the tentative indications of unclogging of stalled investment projects, stabilising of private new investment intentions and improving sales of commercial vehicles. In April, output from core industries constituting 38 per cent of the index of industrial production declined across the board, barring coal production. The sustained revival of coal output augurs well for electricity generation and mining and quarrying, going forward. There is some optimism on gas pricing and availability. The resolution of power purchase processes has to be expedited and power distribution companies' financial stress has to be addressed on a priority basis. Some public sector banks will need more capital to clean up their balance sheets and support lending as investment revives. Leading indicators of services sector activity are emitting mixed signals. A pick-up in service tax collections, sales of trucks, railway freight, domestic air passenger and air freight traffic could augur well for transport and communication and trade. On the other hand, the slowdown in tourist arrivals, railway traffic and3 international air passenger and freight traffic could affect hotels, restaurants and some constituents of transportation services adversely. The services PMI declined in April 2015, mainly on account of slowdown in new business orders. Community and personal services are likely to be held back by the ongoing fiscal consolidation. In April, retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) decelerated for the second month in a row, supported by favourable base effects [of about (-) 0.8 per cent] that moderated the rise in the price index for the fourth successive month. Food inflation softened to a contra-seasonal four-month low, with the impact of unseasonal rains yet to show up. Vegetables inflation continued to ease, along with that of other sub-groups such as cereals, oil, sugar and spices. On the other hand, protein items, especially milk and pulses, continued to impart upward inflationary pressures. Fuel inflation rose for the fourth successive month to a twelve-month high, driven by prices of electricity and firewood. Inflation in these components was accentuated by base effects  the recent price uptick coming on top of muted increases a year ago. Inflation excluding food and fuel rose marginally. House rent, education, medical and transport expenses were among the major drivers of inflation in this category. Rural wage growth, although still moderate, picked up. Inflation expectations remain in high single digits, although they may adapt further to current low inflation. Yet, both input and output price pressures remain muted as reflected in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey. Purchasing managers' indices also corroborate these developments. Liquidity conditions eased in April 2015 after the tightness in the second half of March 2015 on account of advance tax outflows and financial year-end behaviour of banks. The Reserve Bank's liquidity management operations were reversed in view of the improvement in liquidity conditions through April. During May, however, rapid increases in currency in circulation and a build-up of government balances resulted in liquidity conditions tightening again. Accordingly, fine tuning operations of varying tenors were conducted, besides the regular overnight repo at fixed rate and 14-day variable rate repo auctions. These injections helped meet the frictional liquidity requirements. In May, the average daily net liquidity injected through LAF fixed rate repos, besides regular 14-day variable rate repos, additional variable rate repos and MSF, was 1031 billion as compared with 819 billion in April. As a result, weighted average money market rates shadowed the policy rate. Longer term interest rates, particularly gilts, hardened in early May on international cues but eased in the second half of the month, particularly after the issuance of the new benchmark bond. Merchandise export growth has weakened steadily since July 2014 and entered into contraction from January 2015 through April, with a recent shrinking of even volumes exported. The deterioration in export performance affected economies across Asia as global demand fell and the fall in commodity prices impacted terms of trade for commodity exporters. From December 2014 onwards, merchandise import growth also turned negative, led by a sharp decline in the volume of oil imports as inventory build-up by refineries subsided. Gold imports spiked in the month of March and remained elevated in April owing to festival demand and regulatory relaxations. Notably, the volume of imports has been recording increases, despite the value decline. Given these developments, the reduction in the current account deficit resulting from the sharp decline in oil prices has begun to reverse, though the size of the deficit is expected to be contained to about 1.5 per cent of GDP this year. Net exports are, therefore, unlikely to contribute as much to growth going forward as they did in the past financial year. Consequently growth will depend more on a4 strengthening of domestic final demand. While portfolio and direct foreign investment flows were buoyant during 2014-15, with net foreign direct investment to India at US$ 36.6 billion and net portfolio inflows at US$ 41 billion, the year 2015-16 has begun with net portfolio outflows in the wake of a reduction in global portfolio allocations to India. Foreign exchange reserves are around US$ 350 billion, providing a strong second line of defence to good macroeconomic policies if external markets turn significantly volatile. Policy Stance and Rationale 12. Banks have started passing through some of the past rate cuts into their lending rates, headline inflation has evolved along the projected path, the impact of unseasonal rains has been moderate so far, administered price increases remain muted, and the timing of normalisation of US monetary policy seems to have been pushed back. With low domestic capacity utilization, still mixed indicators of recovery, and subdued investment and credit growth, there is a case for a cut in the policy rate today. Yet, of the risks to inflation identified in April, three still cloud the picture. First, some forecasters, notably the IMD, predict a below-normal southwest monsoon. Astute food management is needed to mitigate possible inflationary effects. Second, crude prices have been firming amidst considerable volatility, and geo-political risks are ever present. Third, volatility in the external environment could impact inflation. Therefore, a conservative strategy would be to wait, especially for more certainty on both the monsoon outturn as well as the effects of government responses if it turns out to be weak. With still weak investment and the need to reduce supply constraints over the medium term to stay on the proposed disinflationary path (to 4 per cent in early 2018), however, a more appropriate stance is to front-load a rate cut today and then wait for data that clarify uncertainty. Meanwhile banks should pass through the sequence of rate cuts into lending rates. Assuming reasonable food management, inflation is expected to be pulled down by base effects till August but to start rising thereafter to about 6.0 per cent by January 2016  slightly higher than the projections in April. Putting more weight on the IMD's monsoon projections than the more optimistic projections of private forecasters as well as accounting for the possible inflationary effects of the increases in the service tax rate to 14 per cent, the risks to the central trajectory are tilted to the upside (Chart 1).5 15. Reflecting the balance of risks and the downward revision to GVA estimates for 2014-15, the projection for output growth for 2015-16 has been marked down from 7.8 per cent in April to 7.6 per cent with a downward bias to reflect the uncertainties surrounding these various risks (Chart 2). Strong food policy and management will be important to help keep inflation and inflationary expectations contained over the near term. Furthermore, monetary easing can only create the enabling conditions for a fuller government policy thrust that hinges around a step up in public investment in several areas that can also crowd in private investment. This will be important to relieve supply constraints and aid disinflation over the medium term. A targeted infusion of bank capital into scheduled public sector commercial banks, especially those that implement concerted strategies to clean up stressed assets, is also warranted so that adequate credit flows to the productive sectors as investment picks up.

Euroarea,2015-06-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchase programmes are proceeding well. As explained on previous occasions, our asset purchases of €60 billion per month are intended to run until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. When carrying out its assessment, the Governing Council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation, looking through fluctuations in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Our monetary policy measures have contributed to a broad-based easing in financial conditions, a recovery in inflation expectations and more favourable borrowing conditions for firms and households. The effects of these measures are working their way through to the economy and are contributing to economic growth, a reduction in economic slack, and money and credit expansion. The full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the euro area economy, lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term, and underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of 2015, real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, after 0.3% in the last quarter of 2014. In recent quarters, domestic demand and, particularly, private consumption were the main drivers behind the ongoing recovery. The latest survey data to May remain consistent with a continuation of the modest growth trend in the second quarter. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, the low level of the price of oil should continue to support households' real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. Furthermore, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness. However, economic growth in the euro area is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017. Compared with the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real GDP growth over the projection horizon remain virtually unchanged. While remaining on the downside, the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area have become more balanced on account of our monetary policy decisions and oil price and exchange rate developments. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.3% in May 2015, up from 0.0% in April and compared with -0.6% in January. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain low in the months ahead and to rise towards the end of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. Supported by the expected economic recovery, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption embedded in oil futures markets of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to pick up further during 2016 and 2017. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.3% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. In comparison with the March 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the inflation projections have been revised upwards for 2015 and remain unchanged for 2016 and 2017. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on geopolitical, exchange rate and energy price developments. We acknowledge that the staff projections are conditional on the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures in place. We also take into account that the degree of forecast uncertainty tends to increase with the length of the projection horizon. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the increase in underlying growth in broad money (M3). The annual growth rate of M3 increased to 5.3% in April 2015, up from 4.6% in March. Annual growth in M3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 10.5% in April. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -0.1% in April, after -0.2% in March, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in February 2014. Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued. They continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased further to 1.3% in April 2015, after 1.1% in March. The monetary policy measures we have put in place will support further improvements both in borrowing costs for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to maintain a steady monetary policy course, firmly implementing the Governing Council's monetary policy decisions. The full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the economic recovery in the euro area and lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the implementation of product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. A swift and effective implementation of these reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes. Therefore, it will encourage both households to expand consumption and firms to increase investment today, thus reinforcing the current cyclical economic recovery. As concerns fiscal developments, reflecting mainly the cyclical recovery and the low level of interest rates, the aggregate euro area general government deficit ratio is projected to decline gradually from 2.1% of GDP this year to 1.5% in 2017. The general government debt ratio is projected to decline gradually from 91.5% of GDP this year to 88.4% in 2017. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Full and consistent implementation of the Pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework."
Poland,2015-06-03,"Warsaw, 3 June 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 June 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate 1.75% on an annual basis. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate, although a slight acceleration is expected in 2015. In the euro area a gradual recovery is underway, although economic growth remains low. In the United States, despite the weakening of economic data in the first months of 2015, the recovery is expected to continue in the coming quarters. At the same time, in most major emerging economies activity is weakening, and the economic outlook for Poland's eastern trading partners, i.e. Russia and Ukraine, remains unfavourable. After a sharp and long-lasting fall, oil prices have risen slightly in recent months. This has weakened disinflationary forces in many countries, fuelling increase in price growth in the euro area. However, price growth in the global economy remains very low, and in many European economies it is negative. In these conditions, major central banks are keeping interest rates close to zero and the ECB is continuing its asset purchase programme. In Poland, real GDP growth accelerated in 2015 Q1 (to 3.6% from 3.3% in 2014 Q4). Increase in domestic demand, including consumption and investment, fuelled by an improving labour market situation, good financial condition of enterprises and stable expansion in lending has remained the main driver of economic growth. Economic recovery has been also spurred by accelerating exports, supported by improvement in economic activity in the euro area. April saw, however, a decline in industrial output growth and retail sales growth, although this was most likely temporary. Due to the moderate growth in demand and the continuing negative output gap, there is no demand pressure in the economy. At the same time, low commodity prices and moderate nominal wage growth are contributing to the continued lack of cost pressure. As a result, the annual growth of consumer prices remains negative, although the slight increase in fuel and food prices in the recent period has limited the scale of deflation. However, producer prices growth remains markedly negative, and inflation expectations continue to be very low. 1/2 In the opinion of the Council, the annual price growth will remain negative in the coming months, mainly due to the earlier sharp fall in commodity prices. At the same time, the expected gradual acceleration of economic growth, amidst recovery in the euro area and good situation in the domestic labour market, reduce the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged."
Chile,2015-06-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 June 2015 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, data received after the publication of the Monetary Policy Report confirm the gradual recovery of growth for the rest of the year. Long-term rates and risk premiums increased in most countries, while stock indexes dropped. Capital flows to most emerging-market economies declined. The dollar appreciated around the world. Commodity prices posted mixed movements, and the price of copper fell. Domestically, incoming information is consistent with the baseline scenario of the Monetary Policy Report. In May, inflation was in line with forecasts and is expected to post high annual rates for some months. Its evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. Medium-term inflation expectations remain at 3%. Growth in employment and in the labor force is still low, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged. Growth in nominal wages dropped in annual terms and the peso depreciated. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2015-06-11,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 11, 2015 In its meeting held on June 11, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 925 percen. Headline CPI increased by 191 percent in May compared to an increase of 019 percent in Apri. The annual rate accelerated to 1319 percent in May from 1096 percent in April, partly due to the unfavorable base effect from last yea. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 065 percent in May compared to 023 percent in April, while the annual rate inched up to 814 percent in May after registering 791 percent in Apri. The continued increase in the prices of volatile food items explain the bulk of monthly headline CPI developments and has widened the divergence between the headline and core inflation rate. Upside risks on the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of lower oil prices and the consequent revision in international food price forecast. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 43 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q2 to record 56 percent (y/y) in the first half of the fiscal year, supported by the record growth witnessed in the first quarte. This comes after the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth recorded 22 percent (y/y. The expansion in economic activity during 2014/2015 Q2 came on the back of the continued growth in the manufacturing sector and the expansion of tourism activities for the second consecutive quarter after several quarters of contractio. This came despite the continuous weakness in the extraction secto. In the meantime, while the widening trade deficit is stalling real GDP growth, investment remained positive for the fourth consecutive quarte. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

South Korea,2015-06-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 1.75% to 1.50%. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.75% to 1.50%. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the US appears to be emerging from its temporary economic slowdown and the improvements in the euro area have continued as well. In emerging market countries including China the trends of slowing growth have continued. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries, and by uncertainties over the restructuring of Greek debt. Looking at the Korean economy, the Committee notes that the trend of decline in exports has accelerated and that consumption, which had been showing a recovery, appears to have contracted since the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). On the employment front, the unemployment rate has risen due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, but the employment-to-population ratio has also increased as the number of persons employed has grown. The Committee judges that the downside risks to the domestic growth path forecast in April have expanded, owing mostly to the sluggishness of exports and to the impacts of the MERS outbreak. Consumer price inflation rose slightly from 0.4% the month before to 0.5% in May, due mainly to increases in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose slightly to 2.1%, from 2.0% in April. Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, influenced mostly by strengthened expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar. The won has fluctuated within a certain range against the Japanese yen. Long-term market interest rates have fallen back, after having risen in response mainly to interest rate movements in major countries and to domestic economic indicators. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay greater attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as the trends of capital flows."
Peru,2015-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2015 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the 2.0 percent target in the 2015-2016 forecast horizon and takes into account that: economic activity continues showing levels below its potential level; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range; international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as high volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets, and domestic inflation has been affected by temporary supply-side factors that have been reversing more gradually than expected. Inflation in May showed a rate of 0.56 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.02 percent in April to 3.37 percent in May. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of electricity rates (5.3 percent), meals outside the home (0.5 percent), urban fares (0.7 percent), and gasoline and lubricants (3.9 percent). Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.25 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 2.74 percent in April to 2.84 percent in May. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations continue showing a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels. In June, the Central Bank has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 7.0 to 6.5 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and stands ready to make changes in its monetary policy instruments if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.00 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on July 9, 2015."
Russia,2015-06-15,"On 15 June 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 12.50 to 11.50 percent per annum, taking account of lower inflation risks and persistent risks of considerable economy cooling. Amid significant contraction in consumer demand and ruble appreciation in February-May 2015, consumer price growth continued to slow down. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, given these factors annual inflation will fall to less than 7% in June 2016 to reach the target of 4% in 2017. The Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate as consumer price growth declines further in compliance with the forecast but the potential of monetary policy easing will be limited by inflation risks in the next few months. Having reached its peak in March annual inflation fell to 16.4% in April and 15.8% in May. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the annual rate of consumer price growth stood at 15.6% as of 8 June 2015. Weekly inflation stabilised at about 0.1% in May-early June. Consumer price growth decline was conditioned primarily by lower consumer demand amid contracting real income, and also ruble appreciation in February-May. Moreover, prices have adjusted to external trade restrictions imposed in August 2014 without exerting inflationary pressure. Relatively tough monetary conditions are also conducive to inflation reduction. Money supply (M2) growth rate remains low. Lending and deposit rates are adjusted downwards under the influence of previous Bank of Russia decisions to reduce the key rate. However, they remain high, on the one hand, contributing to attractiveness of ruble savings, and, on the other hand, alongside with tighter borrower and collateral requirements, resulting in lower annual lending growth. Major macroeconomic indicators demonstrate further economy cooling. Though structural factors continue hampering the economic growth, output contraction has currently signs of cyclical nature. It is attested, among other things, by the reduced number of new orders, the on-going decline in production capacity and labour force utilisation, and a certain rise in the unemployment rate. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the labour market adjusts to the new conditions mostly through wage decrease and growing part-time employment. These factors, alongside with a decrease in retail lending, will result in further decline in consumer spending. Fixed capital investments will continue to contract due to economic agents' negative expectations with regard to the Russian economic outlook and tight lending conditions. Investment demand will also be contained by limited substitution of external sources of funding with domestic ones given shallow Russian financial market and high ruble debt burden. Implementation of government anti-recessionary measures will facilitate investments. Sluggish investor and consumer activity will result in low demand for imports. Given the floating exchange rate, exports will decline less significantly. As a result, net exports will be the only component to make a positive contribution to output growth. In 2015. GDP is expected to contract by 3.2%. Further economic situation will depend on the dynamics of energy prices and the economy's ability to adapt to external shocks. According to Bank of Russia forecasts, in 2016. GDP growth will stand at 0.7%, if oil prices recover to US$70 per barrel by late 2016. However, in case oil prices remain at about US$60 per barrel during 2016, output will contract by 1.2%. Slack domestic demand will facilitate inflation reduction in 2015-2017. The ruble appreciation in February-May will have additional restraining influence on prices in the next few months. A slowdown in consumer price growth will make room for inflation expectations decrease. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, annual inflation in June 2016 will slow down to less than 7% to reach the target of 4% in 2017. Inflation risks emanate primarily from aggravation of external economic situation, enhanced inflation expectations, revision of increases in administered prices and tariffs planned for 2016-2017, and fiscal policy easing. The Bank of Russia will be ready to continue cutting the key rate as inflation risks abate and inflation declines further in compliance with the forecast but the potential of monetary policy easing will be limited by inflation risks in the next few months. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 31 July 2015. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30. Moscow time. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia major operations1. (% p.a.).

United States,2015-06-17,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that economic activity has been expanding moderately after having changed little during the first quarter. The pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat. Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown some improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports; energy prices appear to have stabilized. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Jerome H Powell; Daniel K Tarullo; and John C Williams."
Israel,2015-06-22,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor May increased by 0.2 percent, in line with the average of forecasters' projections. There were marked increases in the fruit and vegetables component and in the education, culture and leisure component. The transport and communication component declined. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.4 percent, compared with negative 0.5 percent over the 12 months that ended in April, and negative 1 percent over the 12 months ended in March. In March-May, the increase in the Index returned to a pace consistent with achieving the inflation target, and it seems that the price declines in January-February were one-off occurrences. CPI components representing tradable goods declined by 1.7 percent in the past 12 months, and are still influenced by the decline in energy prices that occurred before those prices recently began to rise. The growth rate of components representing nontradable items continues to increase: prices rose by 0.4 percent over theprevious 12 months. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One-year inflation expectations from various sources remained around the lower bound of the inflation target range this month. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are 1 percent, on average, similar to the previous month, and expectations derived from banks'internal interest rates are 0.7 percent, compared to 0.8 percent last month. Twelve-month ahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market are currently 1.1 percent, and expectations for 2 years are 1.3 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) forward expectations remained around 1.4-1.7 percent this month, while expectations for longer terms (5-10 years) continued to range around the midpoint of the inflation targetrange. Based on the Telbor curve, the probability of a reduction in the interest rate in the next few months declined compared with the previous month. Similar to last month, most private forecasters do not expect a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate. Forecasters project the interest rate in 1 year to be 0.31 percent, on average. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity that became available this month point to the economy continuing to grow in the second half of 2015 at the moderate rate of 2014. In the second estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter, there were downward revisions in growth of GDP (from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent, seasonally adjusted data in annual terms), and business sector product (from 3.2 percent to 2.6 percent), as well as exports (excluding diamonds and startup companies): export data was markedly revised (from growth of 9.4 percent to contraction of 1.9 percent). Growth of private consumption was revised upward (from 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent). Foreign trade data indicate that goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds, in current dollar terms) contracted in April-May by 5.6 percent compared with the first quarter, primarily due to labor disruptions in the chemicals industry; exports excluding chemicals remained stable. Imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds, and fuels) declined by 2.8 percent compared with the first quarter. Business services exports (excluding startup companies) remained stable, with a slight decline of 2.2 percent in March. In January-May, the number of tourist arrivals was 17 percent lower, and overnight stays in January-April were about 25 percent lower, than in the corresponding periods in 2014. The slow recovery of tourism is apparently influenced by, among other things, the economic situation in Russia. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.3 percent in May, mainly as a result of an increase in the import of consumer goods. Preliminarydata from the second quarter Companies Survey indicate stability in activity. The business sector climate index for May continues to indicate that the monthly rate of growth has stabilized at 0.22-0.24 percent. The consumer confidence indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics andby Bank Hapoalim both declined in May. The Purchasing Managers Index continued to decline this month, to 47.6. The labor market: The situation in the labor market remains positive. Labor Force Survey data for May indicate thatthere weren't material changes, compared with April, among the principal working ages (25-64): the unemployment rate remained low (4.3 percent, compared with 4.2 percent in April), and the levels of the participation rate (79.8 percent, as in April) and the employment rate (76.4 percent, compared with 76.5 percent in April) remained elevated. Nominal wages increased by 1 percent, and real wages increased by 1.1 percent, in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 (seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts for March-May were 4.7 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. The job vacancy rate increased slightly in May compared with April. Budget data: In January-May, thedomestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was about NIS 3.2 billion. NIS 0.8 billion greater than the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP, mainly as a result of expenditures being lower than the seasonal path. Since the beginning of the year, total tax revenues are about NIS 1.7 billion higher than the seasonal path, and nontax revenue are about NIS 2 billion lower than the seasonal path. Since the beginning of the year, gross domestic VAT revenues increased by about 8.2 percent in real terms, compared with the corresponding period in 2014. Total tax revenues, net of outlier activities, increased by about 7 percent. Since the beginning of the year, government expenditure wasabout NIS 5.7 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year, mainly as a result of increased defense expenditures. Staff forecast: This month, the ResearchDepartment updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. According to the forecast, the inflation rate over the next four quarters is expected to be 1.6 percent, and 2 percent at the end of 2016; the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected, according to the staff forecast, to remain at 0.1 percent throughout 2015 and to begin to increase at a moderate rate in 2016, among other reasons in light of the expected US federal funds rate increase. At the end of 2016, the interest rate is expected to be 1.25 percent. GDP is expected to grow in 2015 by 3.0 percent (compared with 3.2 percent in the previous forecast), and in 2016 it is expected to grow by 3.7 percent (3.5 percent in the previous forecast). The foreign exchange market: From May 22, 2015, through June 19, 2015, the shekel strengthened by about 1 percent against the dollar, and weakened by about 0.3 percent against the euro. The shekel strengthened by about 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on May 21, 2015, through June 19, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 1.8 percent. Yields in the government bond market increased on both the nominal and CPI-indexed curves by up to 30 basis points; the curves steepened, similar to the global trend. The yield on unindexed bonds with 10 years to maturity increased from about 1.94 percent to around 2.32 percent. There were slight changes along the makam yield curve, and most of the curve was trading at a yield similar to the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained virtually unchanged, at about 69 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in May, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demanddeposits) increased by 46.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.7 percent. The credit market: In May, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 1.3 billion, lower than the average over the past 12 months (NIS 2.7 billion). In addition, foreign realestate companies issued bonds totaling about NIS 2 billion on the Tel AvivStock Exchange in May. Net withdrawals from corporate bond mutual funds continued in May, totaling about NIS 165 million, and there was continued netnew investment of NIS 725 million in general bond funds. Corporate bond market spreads increased in May. New mortgage volume continued to increase, reaching NIS 5.8 billion in May. The share of mortgages extended to buyers purchasing a home as an investment began to decline again, and the share of fixed-rate mortgages taken out continued to increase. In May, mortgage interest rates continued to decline on all indexation tracks. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.3 percent in May, and has increased by 2.1 percent over the past 12 months. In March-April, home prices increased by 0.4 percent, and in the 12 months ending inApril, they increased by 3.4 percent, compared with that figure in the previous month of 3.8 percent. After the elevated levels of housing transactions in the first quarter, preliminary data indicate a decline (mostly seasonal) in the number of transactions in April, among all buyer categories. However, the number of new homes sold continued to increase. In the 12 months ending in March, there were about 43,800 building starts and about 46,100 building completions. The government intends to implement several measures in the housing market, but at this point it is difficult to assess their expected effects. The global economy: This month, the OECDreduced its 2015 global growth and world trade forecasts markedly. Projected GDP growth was lowered to 3.1 percent, from 3.7 percent in the previous forecast, and the world trade growth forecast was lowered to 3.9 percent, from 4.6 percent in the previous forecast. The forecasts for 2016 were reduced more moderately: projected GDP growth of 3.8 percent, compared with 3.9 percent in the previous forecast, and projected world trade growth of 5.3 percent, compared with 5.5 percent in the previous forecast. There were similar changes in the World Bank's forecasts. The main factors in the reduction were weak first quarter growth data in the US, and the slowdown in emerging markets. In contrast, the growth forecast for Europe and Japan were revised upward, against the background of the accommodative monetary environment and low energy prices. In the US, the second estimate of first quarter growth was revised downward, but in the second quarter a recovery to a growth rate of about 2 percent is expected. The interest rate pathderived from assessments of FOMC members in their most recent meeting is lower than the previous path. Even though an increase in the federal funds rate is still expected in 2015, the Fed chair emphasized that there isn't a special significance to the date of the first increase, as policywill remain accommodative for an extended time. In Europe, moderate positive momentum continues. Eurozone retail sales increased by 0.7 percent in April, and the purchasing managers index declined slightly this month, to 53.6, reflecting continued expansion of activity. In May, the unemployment rate began to again decline, though its level remains high at 11.1 percent. The crisis in Greece continues to pose a real risk to Europe's economy, and there were increased assessments of Greece defaulting and exiting the euro bloc. In Japan, confidence indices continue to point to expansion ofactivity, and the industrial production index was notably positive with anincrease of 1.2 percent in April. Weakness continued in emerging markets, primarily in commodity based economies. In China, there was slight improvement in several indicators of activity. Several central banks took steps this month to reduce interest rates. The price of oil declined to around $63 per barrel, compared with about $65 per barrel last month. Commodity prices declined markedly this month; metals prices declined by about 7.5 percent, and agricultural commodity prices declined by about 3.5 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for July 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The pathof the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The inflation environment is beginning to converge to within the target range; in March-May the CPI increased by a rate consistent with the inflation target. Short-term inflation expectations fromvarious sources are around the lower bound of the target range, and the Research Department forecasts an inflation rate of 1.6 percent over the coming year. Expectations for medium and longer terms remain entrenched near themidpoint of the target range. C 2B 7 First quarter GDP growth data was revised downward, against the background of a sharp downward revision in export growth. Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month, including the Composite State of the Economy Index, tax revenue data, labor market data, and preliminary data from the second quarter Companies Survey, support the assessment that growth, led by private consumption, continues at a moderate rate. C 2B 7 Forecasts of global growth were reduced against the background of a transitory slowdown in US growth, and a slowdown in emerging markets. Moderate positive momentum continues in Europe, but the risk deriving from developments in Greece increased. In the US, the federal funds rate is expected to be increased in 2015, but the pace of the increases is expected to be moderate, and in other countries monetary expansion continues.</div> C 2B 7 The shekel strengthened by 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate this month, and has appreciated by 4.7 percent for the year to date. The appreciation and the expected moderation in growth of world trade weigh on the growth of exports and of the tradable sector. C 2B 7 Robust activity in the housing market, both on the supply side and on the demand side, was reflected in high volumes of transactions, building starts and completions, and a very elevated level of new mortgages taken out. March-April data indicated that the increase in home prices continues, but at a more moderate pace than before. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. To Governor's remarks at Press Briefing on Monetary policy The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for July 2015 will be published on July 6, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for August 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 27, 2015. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for July 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The inflation environment is beginning to converge to within the target range; in March-May the CPI increased by a rate consistent with the inflation target. C 2B 7 The shekel strengthened by 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate this month, and has appreciated by 4.7 percent for the year to date. To Governor's remarks at Press Briefing on Monetary policy. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for July 2015 will be published on July 6, 2015."
Armenia,2015-06-23,"PRESS RELEASE 23.06.2015 At the meeting dated June 23, 2015, the Board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia decided to leave the Refinancing Rate unchanged, at 10.5%. There was 0.5% of deflation in May of 2015 compared with 0.8% of deflation recorded in the same month last year. The 12-month inflation rate amounted to 5.1% late in the month. Trends of slow global economic growth persisted in the external sector. Under this circumstance, the international market of food products further saw deflationary patterns, whereas higher-than-expected oil price in the international market of basic commodities has been driven by strong seasonal demand for oil products, reduction in the U.S. inventory as well as expectations for reduced supply. Based on these developments however, the Board of the Central Bank admits that inflationary effects from the external sector in the coming months are not likely. The Board of the Central Bank states that maintaining macroeconomic stability achieved early this year continues to contribute to the recovery of economic activity. In the period January-May, the economic activity indicator has grown by 2.7% mainly owing to the growths recorded in agriculture and industry. It is estimated that positive developments in the agricultural sector will persist, which will result in lower prices of agricultural products in comparison with the same period last year. The inflationary effect expected from electricity price increase since August this year will offset the abovementioned deflationary influences. Also, in the event the Refinancing Rate persists at the current level, the 12-month inflation rate will hover around the upper bound of the confidence band by the end of the year and stabilize around the target starting 2016. The Central Bank will react to economic developments in both external and domestic sectors by adjusting its monetary policy directions, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium-term perspective. Detailed information on the setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) due on July 3, 2015. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Hungary,2015-06-23,"THE MONETARY COUNCIL'S STATEMENT IN THE JUNE 2015 ISSUE OF THE INFLATION REPORT. At its meeting on 23 June 2015, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 15 basis points from 1.65% to 1.50%, with effect from 24 June 2015. THE MONETARY COUNCIL'S STATEMENT ON MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND ITS MONETARY POLICY ASSESSMENT. In the Monetary Council's assessment, persistently loose monetary conditions are consistent with the achievement of price stability. In the Council's assessment, the medium-term achievement of the Bank's inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy point in the direction of maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period. In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target, the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. The performance of the global economy has continued to be subdued in recent months. Inflation rates around the world remain at low levels. Significant differences remain across the individual regions in terms of economic growth. Of the world's developed regions, growth in the euro area picked up slightly on the preliminary estimate in the first quarter of 2015, broadly in line with expectations. By contrast, the US economy contracted relative to the previous quarter. Growth has been stable or slowing in most of the major emerging market economies. Global inflation remains moderate, reflecting low crude oil prices and subdued demand, and inflationary pressure in the global economy is likely to remain moderate looking ahead. The monetary policy stance of globally influential central banks points to the direction of persistently loose monetary conditions: the ECB has continued its quantitative easing policy within the framework of its extended asset purchase programme, the Bank of Japan has maintained the pace of its asset purchases and the Federal Reserve is likely to fine-tune the appropriate timing and magnitude of its interest rate increase likely being postponed to a later date. Monetary conditions remain loose overall and, consequently, global interest rate and liquidity conditions continue to be supportive. In the Council's assessment, inflation is likely to be below the inflation target this year and next, and is expected to rise to levels around 3 per cent only towards the end of the forecast period. The Council expects inflation to be significantly below the inflation target over the short term. Data available in recent months were slightly higher than the projection in the March issue of the Inflation Report, mainly reflecting higher-than-expected fuel prices. Inflation has departed from its historical low in recent months and is likely to remain in positive territory looking ahead. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as the effects of the low-cost environment fade, domestic demand picks up and wages increase. However, inflation is expected to approach levels around the 3 per cent target towards the end of the forecast period, reflecting moderate underlying inflation. The stabilisation of inflation expectations around the target is likely to ensure that price and wage-setting will be consistent with the inflation target over the medium term as domestic demand growth strengthens. Domestic economic growth is likely to continue to be robust, supported by rising external demand, in addition to growing domestic demand. Growth in the domestic economy has continued over recent period. In the coming years, domestic demand is likely to remain the main driver of growth; however, rising exports reflecting strengthening growth in Hungary's export markets are also expected to support domestic economic growth. The low inflation environment and the improvement in the labour market will contribute to household real income growth, which in turn is expected to facilitate household consumption. The conversion of foreign currency loans will reduce the household sector's vulnerability, which may facilitate the gradual easing of consumers' precaution. In addition to the general improvement in economic activity, the Funding for Growth Scheme also supports private sector investment. Household investment activity is expected to strengthen at the forecast horizon, due to the pick-up in the housing market and the extension of the housing subsidy system. Export growth is likely to be strong, reflecting higher growth in Hungary's export markets. The negative output gap is expected to close at the end of the forecast period, and therefore the real economic environment is likely to continue to have a disinflationary impact in the coming quarters. The economy's external vulnerability continues to decrease. Hungary's external financing capacity continued to increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Based on the four-quarter values, the trade surplus rose again, with domestic agents using a significant amount of EU transfers also in the final quarter. Looking at the structure of external financing, the outflow of debt liabilities continued in 2014, and consequently, the decline in Hungary's debt ratios as well. Non-debt liabilities have increased overall. Looking ahead, the external financing capacity is expected to remain robust, exceeding 9 per cent of GDP in 2015. Net exports are expected to rise further, reflecting the expected improvement in external demand and the positive impact on the terms of trade of the decline in oil prices. Transfers from the EU will presumably be lower in 2016. The expected stabilisation of the deficit on the income balance is likely to reflect the combined effect of the decline in interest expenses and rising profits of foreign-owned companies, in addition to a falling debt path. The continued very high net lending is likely to contribute to a gradual decline in the country's external debt ratios. Sentiment in international financial markets was volatile but rather unfavourable. In April, the positive effect of strong macroeconomic data from the euro area offset the negative effect of political events in Greece, mixed macroeconomic data form the US and geopolitical tensions. However, global investor sentiment deteriorated throughout the latter, greater part of the period, reflecting the downgrade of Greek sovereign debt and the postponement of debt repayments as well as weak macroeconomic data from the US economy. Of the domestic risk indicators, the CDS spread has increased slightly and long-term yields on forint-denominated bonds have risen significantly in the period since publication of the March Report, in line with international trends. The forint has depreciated against the euro in the past quarter, due mainly to international factors. In the Council's assessment, a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks. The Monetary Council considered three alternative scenarios around the baseline projection in the June Report, which might influence significantly the future conduct of monetary policy. The rise in yields in developed markets may lead to an increase in the risk premium on developing markets, and therefore the inflation target can be achieved with tighter monetary policy than assumed in the baseline projection. Mounting geopolitical tensions may involve a protracted decline in external demand and a sudden, sharp increase in the risk premium, and therefore tighter monetary policy than assumed in the baseline projection ensures the achievement of the inflation target at the forecast horizon as well. On the other hand, the alternative scenario assuming persistently low cost environment and increasing second-round effects may lead to lower inflation and stronger economic growth, which may justify even looser monetary conditions than the baseline projection. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the output gap is expected to close only gradually. Based on available data, the risk of second-round effects materialising due to excessively low inflation expectations has moderated."
India,2015-06-23,"Summary of the Electronic Consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy: May 2015 Consultation with external Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on monetary policy was held electronically between May 20 and 22, 2015 in the run up to the Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review, 2015-16 on June 2, 2015. The main points suggested by Members are set out below. Members noted that domestic economic activity was weak and the initial optimism regarding growth and investment was waning. Corporate earnings were subdued, growth in industrial production was muted, investment indicators showed no sign of turnaround, credit expansion was yet to pick up, manufacturing growth was at a 5 month low and exports were declining. However, manufacturing growth would possibly improve with policy efforts, particularly with better input supply. While consumption demand was weak with persistent contractions in consumer goods growth over the last several months, expansion of capital goods output in March was a positive indicator. Continuing weak non-food bank credit growth might slow down the pace of the turn-around in GDP growth. The rupee has significantly corrected, which should provide a boost to export growth. Members felt that more monetary accommodation would support the growth process at this juncture. On inflation. Members were of the view that though there are risks to inflation from a possibly weak monsoon and pickup in oil prices, the inflation  both headline and excluding food and fuel had declined significantly during 2014-15. In April, 2015 inflation edged lower because of a sharp decline in food inflation while inflation excluding food and fuel edged up marginally. Further downturn of inflation excluding food and fuel, which has flattened in recent months, is unlikely. The upside risk caused by increase in crude prices since the last monetary policy review, and the Government's willingness to allow increases to be passed through into retail prices, will lead to possibly steeper increase going forward. The risks to headline inflation from food, depending on the extent of monsoon deficiency or uneven spatial distribution, can be mitigated by timely release of food stocks, as well as muted MSP increases. High frequency data suggest that the cyclical recovery is weak mitigating demand pressures, and input price pressures are also low. Rural wage growth remains modest despite early signs of recovery. Therefore, both cost-push and demand pull factors are muted. Overall, inflation risks remain under control. A Member felt that low inflation readings also implied that the real interest rates were too high. On the external sector. Members expressed concern over subdued demand from across the globe and reflected in contraction in exports for a few months in a row despite depreciation of the rupee. The European Central Bank's (ECB) quantitative easing (QE) program has had a powerful effect on weakening the Euro, boosting confidence and lifting inflation in the Eurozone. The program was motivated largely to mitigate the threat to deflation. The US Fed is in wait-and-see mode. Second2 quarter US GDP was weak, and the annualized monthly rate of inflation for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was close to 2 per cent. The Fed is aware of the potential of a discontinuous jump in wage growth as the US economy approaches 5 per cent unemployment. This is why the Fed may not want to see accelerating wage growth before hiking rates. However, the odds are against the Fed seeing a path to a June rate hike. This suggests there is some monetary space to increase financial accommodation. All seven Members have recommended a reduction in policy repo rate  four members advocated a cut by 25 basis points; two members suggested a 50 basis points reduction and one member proposed a reduction by 75 basis points. The Members who had recommended a reduction in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points were of the view that notwithstanding risks to inflation from monsoon and oil prices, sharp reduction in inflation warrants a reduction in policy rate when consumption and external demand were weak and investment was showing a potential to revive. Members noted that the monetary policy review in April by the Reserve bank highlighted a set of conditions for further monetary accommodation  more transmission by banks, supply response from the government on food prices, and signs of US monetary policy normalizing. Since the evidence on these is mixed, a wait-and-see approach was warranted. However, with low inflation readings and its likely impact on inflation expectations that are adaptive, there is some monetary space to support the growth process. One of these Members also recommended that the SLR should also be reduced by 50 basis points. The Members who recommended larger reduction in the policy repo rate were of the view that with the continuing benign trends in retail and wholesale inflation, improved prospects of monsoon, oil prices at a sustainable level from which they are unlikely to rise further, weak data on economic activity, and the need to nudge the real effective exchange rate downwards, a 50 bps reduction in repo and reverse repo rates is desirable along with a possible announcement of a pause. Some of these Members were of the view that many central banks have cut rates recently and policy rates in India are one of the highest in the world in comparison to its inflation. This invites carry from arbitrage seeking inflows that reverse during global risk-off, creating volatility. As the US Fed rate hike is likely to be delayed, lower policy rate in India will help banks reduce their loan rates. One of these Members was of the view that a 25 basis points cut now should be followed with another after seeing the performance of the monsoon. One of these Members also suggested that the SLR should be reduced by 50 basis points. According to the Member who recommended a 75 basis points reduction in policy rate, given the size of capital required for infrastructure projects, cost of capital is not a small matter in the investment decision process, even though it is not the only factor holding up infrastructure projects. Although the government has made strenuous efforts to bring down food inflation with sale of stocks and keeping a lid on the minimum support price, food inflation can be brought down in the medium term by enabling investment in drip irrigation systems, storage and logistics. All the seven external Members  Shri Y.H. Malegam. Dr.Shankar Acharya. Dr.Arvind Virmani. Prof. Indira Rajaraman. Prof. Errol D'Souza. Prof. Ashima Goyal, and Prof. Chetan Ghate  sent their feedback through e-mail. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of discussions of the meetings of TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting.

Turkiye,2015-06-23," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Inflation is expected to decline in the short term owing to a partial correction in food prices. Yet, recent movements in the exchange rates have delayed the improvement in the core indicators. This, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy. The Committee has therefore decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Philippines,2015-06-24,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that, on balance, current monetary policy settings remain appropriate given the within-target inflation forecasts and the underlying strength of domestic demand conditions. Latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that inflation is likely to settle within the lower half of the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2015-2016, while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored following recent inflation outturns. The Monetary Board likewise observed that the risks to the inflation outlook continue to be broadly balanced, with upside risks coming from pending petitions for power rate adjustments and the impact of stronger-than-expected El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates. On the other hand, slower global economic activity could pose downside risks to inflation. The Monetary Board noted that domestic demand conditions remain firm despite the lower-than-expected first-quarter output growth, supported by solid private household and capital spending as well as buoyant business confidence. At the same time, ample domestic liquidity and planned higher public spending are expected to further support domestic economic activity and sustain the economy's momentum in the months ahead. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriately calibrated to the outlook for inflation and domestic economic activity. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor domestic and external developments to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains in line with maintaining price and financial stability."
Czech Republic,2015-06-25,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate to be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to prices and other nominal variables. The Bank Board assesses the risks to the current inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being balanced. In this situation, the Bank Board stated again that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the second half of 2016. The Czech National Bank remains ready to move the exchange rate commitment if there were to be a long-term increase in deflation pressures capable, among other things, of causing a slump in domestic demand or a systematic decrease in inflation expectations. However, the probability of such developments has decreased since the Bank Board's previous monetary policy meeting. Nevertheless, the Bank Board stated that even in the light of the data which have become available since its previous monetary policy meeting, the assumption that inflation will merely approach the target from below at the monetary policy horizon remains in place. Domestic inflation increased in the last two months. In May, it reached 0.7%, i.e. 0.4 percentage point above the forecast. This pick-up in inflation was due to all consumer basket components, especially food prices. Adjusted inflation excluding fuels also contributed to higher inflation, reflecting the rapid growth in the domestic economy and the marked improvement on the labour market, as well as the impact of the weaker exchange rate of the koruna against the dollar. By contrast, the direct effect of the weakened exchange rate of the koruna against the euro on inflation through import prices is unwinding and inflation abroad remains subdued. On the basis of new information, inflation can be expected to be higher than the current forecast, but still well below the inflation target, in the next 12 months, i.e. before the monetary policy horizon. The annual growth of the Czech economy accelerated sharply to 4.2% in 2015 Q1, whereas the forecast had been less than half this figure. The unexpectedly sharp increase in economic growth was due chiefly to a rise in inventories, which accounted for more than one-half of the annual GDP growth. However, the other expenditure components except net exports also recorded positive contributions to economic growth. Although the result for Q1 was largely affected by one-off factors which may undergo a correction in the future. GDP growth was relatively strong even when adjusted for these factors. It is therefore probable that the Czech economy will continue to record faster annual growth in the rest of this year compared to the forecast. According to new information about developments abroad obtained from the June Consensus Forecasts survey, the growth rate of effective external demand is expected to be slightly higher than assumed in the current forecast. By contrast, the outlook for industrial producer prices this year has been lowered on account of a substantial price decline observed in Q1. Growth in producer prices is not expected to resume until next year, coupled with increasing growth in economic activity and an unwinding of the effect of lower oil prices. However, slightly higher consumer price inflation is expected over the entire forecast horizon in connection with the accelerating economic activity and observed price developments in the euro area. The outlook for the three-month EURIBOR in 2016 has increased somewhat as a result of higher bond yields, faster economic growth and higher inflation expectations in the euro area. The market outlook for Brent crude oil prices has shifted marginally upwards over the entire horizon owing to currently higher prices. However, as regards oil prices in euro terms and, in turn, in koruna terms, this increase is outweighed by a shift of the outlook towards a stronger euro against the dollar in the rest of this year. This revision was due mainly to less favourable macroeconomic data in the USA. The accelerating domestic economic growth is fostering a further improvement in the labour market situation. The growth rates of total employment and the number of employees have increased further. In May 2015, the number of unemployed persons was the lowest since June 2009 and the number of job vacancies registered with labour offices was the highest since December 2008. Average wage growth in the business sector picked up pace in 2015 Q1, standing slightly above the current forecast. The April data on industry also suggest continuing wage growth in corporations. Indicators from the real economy point to ongoing robust economic growth. In year-on-year terms, industrial production is rising steadily at a pace above 4% and construction output growth exceeded 8% in April. Retail sales also continued to rise apace in both the automotive segment and the non-automotive segment. The price decrease in manufacturing, which started in November 2014 in connection with the drop in oil prices and a decline in euro area producer prices, still persists, but its pace has been falling gradually since March. By contrast, the year-on-year decline in agricultural producer prices has been deepening further this year. The price increase in market services has almost halted since February, but prices of construction work are still rising moderately. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, annual GDP growth was considerably above the forecast in 2015 Q1 and inflation was also higher than forecasted in May. The average wage increased slightly faster than expected in Q1, owing to developments in the business sector. The seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons fell somewhat more sharply compared to the forecast. However, the output of the domestic economy is still below potential."
Ukraine,2015-06-26,"The regular meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Ukraine (hereinafter  the Committee) was held on June 24  25, 2015. The meeting discussed possible changes in the parameters of monetary instruments given the outlook for the economy and future developments in the money market. The Committee members adopted decisions on the following:. to keep the discount rate at 30%. The Committee members pointed to somewhat lower inflationary risks, despite the continued high rate of inflation. Consumer Price Index (CPI) growth stood at 58.4% yoy in May. (Annual CPI inflation has declined from 60.9% in April). The strengthening of the hryvnia exchange rate against the U.S. dollar since April and the narrowing of the exchange rate fluctuation range have contributed to containing price growth. The improvement of the situation in the forex market and stabilization of expectations have encouraged the return of deposits to the banking system. Since the beginning of June, domestic currency deposits have increased by 1.9%. Given the stability in the money market and weak aggregate demand, the Committee expects inflation to continue decelerating in the coming months. With a view to consolidating the positive developments in the money market and anchoring expectations, the Committee members recommended keeping the discount rate unchanged and shifting to loosening the monetary policy stance should inflationary risks subside further;. to streamline approaches to carrying out liquidity sterilization operations. The Committee deems it expedient to streamline the existing practice of carrying out liquidity-absorbing operations to sterilize excess liquidity in the banking system, inter alia, through:. the placement of certificates of deposit with a maturity of 1 up to 3 months, with the interest rate thereon being set through limited-amount interest-rate tenders;. sales of government bonds from the portfolio of the National Bank. The aim of these changes is to strengthen the role of market-based factors in influencing the functioning of the money market through the deployment of efficient price-setting mechanisms and by enabling to form a yield-to-maturity curve, reviving the secondary market of government bonds, and providing banks with additional instruments designed to diversify their asset-side operations;. to approve the Inflation Report, including its section containing inflation projections, and endorse its publication. The macroeconomic forecast for 2015-2016 is based on assumptions of a sustainable ceasefire, the gradual recovery of businesses in Donetsk and Luhansk regions and that the benefits of currency depreciation will feed through to the increased price competiveness. Another important assumption is that Ukraine will continue its cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and remain on track with fulfilling its commitments under the Extended Fund Facility arrangement, including commitments to undertake financial and energy sector reforms, fiscal and general economic reforms, which coupled with a successful restructuring of external sovereign debt will have a positive effect on economic recovery. According to the NBU's estimates, economic growth is expected to recover in Q3 2015 (compared with the previous quarters), driven primarily by net export growth and the utilization of spare capacity. Overall. GDP is projected to fall by 9.5% in 2015. Real GDP is projected to rebound in 2016, growing at an annualized rate of 3%. The burst of depreciation in February-March caused CPI inflation to accelerate significantly. In the January through May period, the consumer price index rose by 40.1%, whereas in annualized terms. CPI inflation accelerated from 24.9% in December to 58.4% in May. Inflation accelerated at the fastest pace in March and April, reflecting the impact of the pass-through of the deepest currency depreciation in late February and increases in utility tariffs. These factors contributed to the decision to revise the forecast for headline inflation upwards to 48% for this year-end (core inflation was revised upwards to 36%). This revision reflects price increases in the previous months rather than downbeat expectations  over the next months, inflation is projected to steadily drift down  to 12% at the end of 2016. Inflation will slow down, reflecting the fading impact of the pass-through of currency depreciation, falling global prices, below-potential economic activity, and tight and fiscal monetary policy. The full version of the Inflation Report will be published on the NBU's official website on July 2, 2015."
Georgia,2015-07-01,"01.07.2015 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate By 0.5 Percentage Points To 5.5% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 1, 2015 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, which shows increase in the inflation expectations as well as in the domestic and external risks affecting the forecast inflation. In line with the existing forecast the Monetary Policy Committee considers necessary to increase the monetary policy rate gradually to 6.5 percent by the end of the year. The domestic demand remains weak. According to preliminary information in May the economic activity grew by 2.1%. The recovery of the demand is furthermore hindered by the decline in the loan growth in the recent months. The significant decrease in import also indicates the weakened demand. The inflation rate has been increasing during the recent months with the annual decrease in fuel prices partially offsetting the inflation rise. The deterioration in economic trends in our main trade partners continues to affect negatively Georgian economy. Goods export, and remittances have decreased, while the growth rate in tourism inflows is low. At the same time the pressure on the policy of the National Bank pushes up the long-term interest rates, reduces the efficiency of the monetary policy transmission and drives up the inflation expectations. The changes in the exchange rate have already affected the import demand, which in turn ensures the adjustment of external imbalance. According to current forecast the inflation will reach its target value in the second half of 2015. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 12, 2015."
Romania,2015-07-01,"The NBR is closely monitoring the domestic and international developments in order to ensure an adequate use and dosage of its instruments in a bid to achieve the price stability objective in the medium term and maintain financial stability. The latest macroeconomic data point to the annual inflation rate remaining below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target, along with the pick-up in economic growth in 2015 Q1, driven by stronger final consumption and investment. In May 2015, the annual inflation rate climbed to a higher-than-expected 1.2 percent, as volatile prices saw a relative step-up in their annual increase, while the average annual inflation rate was stuck at 0.9 percent for the third month in a row. The average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, stayed put at 1.1 percent. The assessment of monetary indicators reveals faster growth of leu-denominated loans, amid the successive policy rate cuts, the gradual reduction in minimum reserve requirements ratio on credit institutions' leu-denominated liabilities and adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Forex loans (stocks) contracted further, their share in total credit to the private sector reaching 53.7 percent, a record low since December 2007, from a peak of 64.4 percent in May 2012, which helps mitigate the risks to financial stability. This development is beneficial for consolidating monetary policy transmission and for strengthening the resilience of the Romanian financial system. At the same time, the exchange rate of the leu posted relatively larger fluctuations, on the back of tensions relative to the situation in Greece and international financial market volatility. The most recent assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to enter and remain in negative territory over the short term, as a result of broadening the scope of the reduced VAT rate to all food items and public food services as of 1 June 2015, but also amid the narrowing of the negative output gap at a quicker pace and the rise in unit labour costs. All these, combined with the current state of affairs, i.e. the situation in Greece, uncertainty surrounding Romania's agreements with international institutions and the divergence between the monetary policy stances of major central banks worldwide, call for a prudent reconsideration of the monetary policy cycle. In light of the above and based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 1.75 percent per annum, to continue to pursue an adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the present levels of the minimum reserve requirements ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board reiterates that its decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term in a manner supportive of sustainable economic growth, also via the rebound in lending, while safeguarding financial stability. The prudent monetary policy stance and the preventive measures taken in the area of prudential supervision of the banking sector are meant to reinforce the Romanian economy's capacity to withstand external shocks. The NBR is closely monitoring the domestic and international economic developments in order to ensure an adequate use and dosage of its available instruments so as to achieve the price stability objective in the medium term and maintain financial stability. According to the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 4 August 2015.  Video: Press briefing, 1 July 2015 (Romanian only)."
Mongolia,2015-07-02,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Monetary policy decision Number: 2015/03 Effective date: 2 July 2015 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia decided to keep current policy interest rate unchanged, at its recurrent meetings on the 9th and 30th of June, and the 2nd of July 2015. Annual inflation measured by CPI declined to 8.0% nationwide and 7.5% in Ulaanbaatar city while core inflation has gradually been going down to 10.2% as of May 2015. Inflation target for 2015 has been achievable because supply-driven inflationary pressure has already been decreased and demand-pull inflation is not expected to increase throughout this year. Positive changes and developments on the balance of payments from the beginning of this year enable to have no deficit on the overall balance of payments in the first half of 2015. However, foreign direct investment has been lower than 1% of GDP and both government budget expenditure and deficit have still been increasing since the beginning of this year. These negative conditions have been restricting the opportunities to ease monetary policy stance. The decision shall retain togrog yield and continuously promote macroeconomic external balance. If there are significant improvements on foreign direct investment and government budget position in the second half of this year, it may enable to create a favorable condition to ease current monetary policy stance. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Poland,2015-07-08,"Warsaw, 8 July 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 July 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate 1.75% on an annual basis. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate. In the euro area, economic conditions improve gradually, although activity is still low. In the United States, recent data suggest that the slowdown at the beginning of the year was temporary and the economic outlook is favourable. In turn, economic growth in China remains low as for this country, while recession continues in Poland's eastern trading partners, i.e. Russia and Ukraine. Despite the ongoing recovery in developed economies, the sentiment in the financial markets has recently deteriorated in the wake of growing fears of a Greek insolvency. This was conducive to a fall in prices of some financial assets as well as a weakening of exchange rates of Central and Eastern European currencies, including the zloty. Following a sharp and long-lasting fall, oil prices have risen slightly in recent months. This has weakened disinflationary forces in many countries, fuelling an increase in price growth in the euro area. However, price growth in the global economy remains very low, and in some European economies it is still negative. In these conditions, major central banks are keeping interest rates close to zero and the ECB is continuing its asset purchase programme. In Poland. GDP growth in 2015 Q2 most likely continued at a previous quarter level. Increase in consumption and investment, fuelled by an improving labour market situation, good financial condition of enterprises and a rise in lending, has probably remained the main driver of economic growth. At the same time, recent data do not indicate acceleration of economic growth in the coming quarters. Due to the moderate pace of growth in demand and the continuing negative output gap, there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Moreover, low commodity prices and moderate nominal wage growth are contributing to the continued lack of cost pressure. As a result, the annual growth of consumer prices remains negative, although the increase in the annual growth of fuel and food prices in the recent period has limited the scale of deflation. The annual growth of producer prices is also negative, while inflation expectations remain very low. 1/2 The Council became acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on NBP interest rates. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 22 June 2015 (projection cut-off date)  there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of -1.1÷ -0.4% in 2015 (as compared to -1.0÷0.0% in the March 2015 projection), 0.7÷2.5% in 2016 (as compared to -0.1÷1.8%) and 0.5÷2.6% in 2017 (as compared to 0.1÷2.2%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth rate  in line with this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.0÷4.3% in 2015 (as compared to 2.7÷4.2% in the March 2015 projection), 2.3÷4.5% in 2016 (as compared to 2.2÷4.4%) and 2.5÷4.7% in 2017 (as compared to 2.4÷4.6%). In the opinion of the Council, the annual price growth will remain negative in the coming months, mainly due to the earlier sharp fall in commodity prices. At the same time, the expected stable economic growth, amidst recovery in the euro area and good situation in the domestic labour market, reduce the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. Such an assessment is supported by NBP's July projection. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged."
South Korea,2015-07-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has grown evident again, and that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well. In emerging market countries including China the trends of slowing growth have continued. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the heightened international financial market volatility due to the situation in Greece, by changes in the monetary policies of major countries and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, amid continued sluggishness in exports the Committee notes that, under the influence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak for example, consumption has declined significantly and the sentiments of economic agents have worsened. On the employment front, the unemployment rate has risen due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, but the employment-to-population ratio has also increased as the number of persons employed has grown. The Committee forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of recovery going forward, owing chiefly to the expansionary macroeconomic policies and to the subsiding of the shock from the MERS outbreak, but judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation rose from 0.5% the month before to 0.7% in June, due mainly to increases in prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to a narrowing of the extent of decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to 2.0%, from 2.1% in May. Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, influenced mostly by the situation in Greece, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Long-term market interest rates have risen, in response mainly to expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and of an increased volume of Korean Treasury bond issuance. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as the situation in Greece and shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as the trends of capital flows."
Malaysia,2015-07-09,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. While growth across the advanced economies has improved, it has remained modest. In most of Asia, domestic demand continues to support growth despite weaker exports. Looking ahead, the recovery in global growth performance has, however, become vulnerable to increased downside risks. International financial markets have also become more volatile following increased concerns over developments in Europe and continued policy uncertainties in several major advanced countries. There are also downside risks to growth in the major Asian economies. For Malaysia, the latest indicators point to continued expansion of the economy in the second quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace. Overall growth continues to be underpinned by domestic demand. Growth in private consumption is expected to be slower following the frontloading of consumption activity prior to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the first quarter. While households are expected to continue adjusting to the GST in the immediate future, overall spending will be supported by continued wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be driven by capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as for infrastructure projects. These developments will contribute towards offsetting the weaker performance of the external sector. On balance, the prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path, with domestic demand being the key driver of growth. Headline inflation averaged at 2% in April and May. Going forward, headline inflation is expected to be higher following the impact of the GST and the recent adjustments to domestic fuel prices, before moderating towards the second half of 2016. Nevertheless, underlying inflation is expected to remain contained amid stable domestic demand conditions. While recent global and domestic developments have affected the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets, there remains ample liquidity in the domestic financial system with continued orderly functioning of the financial and foreign exchange markets. The financial institutions are also operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers. Access to financing has continued with credit growth remaining at healthy levels. Financial intermediation has therefore continued to support the economy. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are heightened risks to global growth and financial conditions. These risks are being carefully monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. Due to the revised schedule of international meetings, the September MPC meeting has been rescheduled to Thursday 10 September and Friday 11 September 2015, from Wednesday 2 September and Thursday 3 September 2015.

Chile,2015-07-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 July 2015 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, the biggest news has been the volatility of financial markets, associated to developments in Greece and China, which has tended to moderate most recently. In this context, after a significant drop during the month, the prices of the risker assets showed a substantial recovery in recent days. The dollar appreciated around the world. The prices of commodities, particularly copper and oil, declined. Domestically, in June the CPI rose more than expected and in annual terms surpassed the 4% mark again. One year ahead, market expectations increased, but two years ahead they remained unchanged. The evolution of inflation will continue to be monitored with special attention. Meanwhile, output and demand have been weaker than assumed in the Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario, and private growth expectations have dropped for this and next year. Confidence indicators have not recovered. In the labor market, job creation remains bounded and nominal wages have decelerated. At the same time, the peso has depreciated. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2015-07-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2015 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the 2.0 percent target in the 2015-2016 forecast horizon and takes into account that: economic activity continues growing at levels below its potential level; inflation expectations have increased, but remain within the target range; international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as high volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets, and domestic inflation has been affected by temporary supply- side factors that have been reversing more gradually than expected. Inflation in June showed a rate of 0.33 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.37 percent in May to 3.54 percent in June. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of gas (7.0 percent), sugar (9.9 percent), meals outside the home (0.4 percent), onions (11.1 percent), water rates (2.7 percent), and gasoline and lubricants (3.1 percent). Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.26 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 2.84 percent in May to 3 percent in June. Inflation is expected to show a rate of 3 percent at end-2015 and a rate of 2.8 percent at end-2016. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations continue showing an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and stands ready to make changes in its monetary policy instruments if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.00 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on August 13, 2015."
Euroarea,2015-07-16,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchase programmes continue to proceed smoothly. As explained on previous occasions, our monthly asset purchases of €60 billion are intended to run until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. When carrying out its assessment, the Governing Council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation and the medium-term outlook for price stability. All in all, the information that has become available since the Governing Council meeting in early June has been broadly in line with our expectations. Recent developments in financial markets, which partly reflect greater uncertainty, have not changed the Governing Council's assessment of a broadening of the euro area's economic recovery and a gradual increase in inflation rates over the coming years. The ECB's monetary policy stance remains accommodative and market-based inflation expectations have, on balance, stabilised or recovered further since our meeting in early June. The latest information also remains consistent with a continued pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. Our measures thereby continue to contribute to economic growth, a reduction in economic slack, and money and credit expansion. The full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term, and will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. Looking ahead, we will continue to closely monitor the situation in financial markets, as well as the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the outlook for price stability. If any factors were to lead to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy, or if the outlook for price stability were to materially change, the Governing Council would respond to such a situation by using all the instruments available within its mandate. Let me now explain our assessment of the available information in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area quarterly real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.4% in the first quarter of 2015, supported by contributions from private consumption and investment. The latest survey data, available up to June, remain consistent with a continuation of the moderate growth trend in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to broaden further. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, the recent decline in oil prices should provide additional support for households' real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. Furthermore, demand for euro area exports should benefit from improvements in price competitiveness. However, the ongoing slowdown in emerging market economies continues to weigh on the global outlook and economic growth in the euro area is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area have generally been contained as a result of our monetary policy decisions, as well as oil price and exchange rate developments. Inflation bottomed out at the beginning of the year and has moved back into positive territory in recent months. According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.2% in June 2015, slightly down from 0.3% in May. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain low in the months ahead and to rise towards the end of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. Supported by the expected economic recovery, the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption embedded in oil futures markets of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are expected to pick up further during 2016 and 2017. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on geopolitical, energy and exchange rate developments. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm robust growth in broad money (M3). The annual growth rate of M3 was 5.0% in May 2015, compared with 5.3% in April. Annual growth in M3 continues to be strongly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 11.2% in May. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.1% in May, up from -0.1% in April, continuing its gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in February 2014. This is consistent with the positive evidence from the bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2015. Banks reported a continued net easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises which was stronger than expected in the previous survey round. Net demand for loans to enterprises increased further, supported by demand for credit related to fixed investment. Fragmentation in terms of credit demand in individual countries decreased and the targeted longer-term refinancing operations helped to improve the terms and conditions for credit supply. Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued. They continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.4% in May 2015, after 1.3% in April. Overall, the monetary policy measures we have put in place since June 2014 provide clear support for improvements both in borrowing conditions for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to maintain a steady monetary policy course, firmly implementing the Governing Council's monetary policy decisions. The full implementation of all our monetary policy measures will provide the necessary support to the economic recovery in the euro area and lead to a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, in order to increase investment, boost job creation and raise productivity, both the implementation of product and labour market reforms and actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. A swift and effective implementation of these reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Full and consistent implementation of the Pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework."
Hungary,2015-07-21,"At its meeting on 21 July 2015, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 15 basis points from 1.50% to 1.35%, with effect from 22 July 2015. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and the domestic real economic environment is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pick-up in domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, unemployment continues to exceed its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Consumer prices continued to show low dynamics in June, rising slightly compared with both the previous month and the same period a year earlier. The inflation data received was consistent with both the projection in the June Inflation Report and market expectations. Core inflation was unchanged relative to May. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the short-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets, the low level of imported inflation and the degree of unused capacity in the economy. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as the effects of the low-cost environment fade, domestic demand picks up and wages increase. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and the low inflation environment is likely to persist. Consequently, inflation is expected toapproach levels around the 3 per cent target only towards the end of the forecast horizon, reflecting moderate underlying inflation. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue at a rapid pace. Robust growth has been supported by both domestic and external demand. On the expenditure side, domestic demand growth may have continued. In May, the trade surplus was significantly higher than its level a year previously. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable in recent months, with the volume of sales increasing across a wide range of products. Based on data for May, industrial production expanded somewhat less dynamically relative to the same period a year earlier than in previous months. Rising household real income underpinned by low inflation, the reduced need for deleveraging and growing employment are expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pick up gradually, owing to the recovery in activity, the Funding for Growth Scheme and its extension. Unemployment fell in May as the activity rate remained unchanged. Overall, international investor sentiment has been unfavourable in the period since the Council's latest policy decision. The various indicators of risk rose and the major equity indices fell. Tensions surrounding the financing of Greek government debt and the country's potential exit from the euro area as well as concerns about the disturbances in Chinese capital markets had a negative impact on global investor sentiment in the first part of the period. However, in the latter half of the period, global appetite for risk improved. Accompanied by noticeable fluctuations, the forint depreciated against the euro, driven by international factors, before appreciating considerably as investor sentiment improved. The domestic CDS spread has remained broadly unchanged and long-term government bond yields have fallen since the previous policy decision. Persistently high external financing capacity of the Hungarian economy and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's assessment, a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. The real economy is likely to have a disinflationary impact at the policy horizon and the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually. Based on available data, the risk of second-round effects materialising due to excessively low inflation expectations has moderated. In the Council's assessment, the policy rate has reached the level which ensures the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, the inflation outlook and the cyclical position of the economy point to the direction of loose monetary conditions for an extended period."
Turkiye,2015-07-23," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a)Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b)One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,. c)Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Food and energy price developments affect inflation favorably in the short run, while exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. This delay, combined with the uncertainty in global markets and volatility in energy and food prices, makes it necessary to maintain the cautious stance in monetary policy. The Committee has therefore decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2015-07-23,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 23 July 2015 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the global environment has been dominated by heightened uncertainty relating to the debt crisis in Greece and the sharp decline in equity prices in China. While the tail risks from these events appear to have dissipated somewhat, uncertainties still remain. At the same time, the risks associated with financial market volatility related to the timing of the first increase in the US policy rate persist. Domestically, the growth outlook remains weak, as both the supply and demand sides remain constrained amid declining business and consumer confidence. The inflation forecast has deteriorated slightly since the previous meeting, notwithstanding the lower-than- expected outcome in June. Headline inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range during the first two quarters of next year, while upside risks posed by the exchange rate have increased. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,6 per cent and 4,7 per cent in May and June respectively. 1 The latter surprised on the downside, due inter alia to lower than expected increases in food price and rental inflation, with upside pressures coming from higher petrol prices. The categories of housing and utilities, food and non-alcoholic beverages, and miscellaneous goods and services contributed 3,1 percentage points to the overall inflation outcome. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, moderated from 5,7 per cent in May to 5,5 per cent in June. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods continued its upward trend having reached a low point of 2,6 per cent in February. In April and May, the PPI measured 3,0 per cent and 3,6 per cent respectively. The latter was above market consensus, and driven by higher than expected food, beverage and tobacco product prices, which, at 2,2 percentage points, was also the main contributor to the annual change in the PPI. The upward trend is expected to persist, driven by rising agricultural crop prices and electricity tariffs. The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with headline inflation now expected to average 5,0 per cent in 2015, up from 4,9 per cent previously. The forecast for the first two quarters of next year has also been revised up by 0,1 percentage point to 6,9 per cent and 6,1 per cent respectively, with a return to within the target range by the third quarter. However, the forecast average inflation for both 2016 and 2017 is unchanged at 6,1 per cent and 5,7 per cent. The forecast for core inflation is unchanged, and expected to average 5,6 per cent in 2015, and moderating to 5,4 per cent and 5,2 per cent in the next two years. As before, much of the persistence of core inflation at these levels is attributed to high 2. As before, much of the persistence of core inflation at these levels is attributed to high 2 levels of wage growth, currency depreciation and inflation expectations entrenched at the upper end of the target range. The headline inflation forecast assumes electricity price increases of 13,0 per cent from July 2016 and July 2017. Although the current multi-year price determination allows for an 8 per cent increase from July next year. Eskom is expected to apply for a claw-back on diesel usage, and this accounts for the additional 5 percentage point assumption in the model. The main assumptions underlying the model are listed in the annexure to this statement. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University have shown a near-term deterioration, but are more or less unchanged over the 2 to 3 year horizon. Average inflation expectations for 2015 and 2016 increased by 0,2 percentage points, to 5,6 per cent and 6,1 per cent, but declined marginally to 5,8 per cent for 2017. The deterioration was mainly driven by marked increases of 0,6 and 0,4 percentage points by analysts for 2015 and 2016, and smaller increases by business people. The expectations of analysts and trade unionists remain within the target, but close to the upper end of the target range. The expectations of business people are above the target range with a deterioration over all three years. Average 5-year inflation expectations increased from 5,8 per cent to 6,0 per cent. The median inflation expectations of analysts polled in the Reuters Econometer survey are almost identical to the Bank's forecast. The break-even inflation expectations as reflected in the yield differential between conventional government 3. The break-even inflation expectations as reflected in the yield differential between conventional government 3 bonds and inflation linked bonds are relatively unchanged since the previous meeting, and remain above the target range for all maturities. Global economic growth has been revised downwards recently, mainly due to the weak first quarter outcome in the US. While the recovery in the US still appears to be on track amid continued improvements in the labour market, growth this year is expected to be closer to the 2 per cent level, compared with expectations of around 3 per cent earlier in the year. The steady, but slow improvement in the euro area has continued, following a better-than-expected first quarter outcome. However, the outlook for the region will be dependent in part on avoiding negative spillovers from the Greek debt crisis. The near term risks from this crisis appear to have been averted for now, but the longer term sustainability of the Greek debt burden remains a concern. Growth in Japan is expected to remain positive but subdued. The Chinese economy grew at a year-on-year rate of 7,0 per cent in the second quarter, but some moderation is expected in the coming quarters. The sharp correction in the Chinese equity markets appears to have been contained by strong intervention by the authorities, and the impact on the broader economy is expected to be relatively limited, but it does point to some fragility in the financial sector. The slowdown in China has continued to impact on commodity prices, with the platinum price, for example, declining to its lowest level in six years. The prospects for a number of other larger emerging market economies, particularly Russia and Brazil, remain weak. 4 Global inflation pressures, particularly in the advanced economies remain benign, reinforced by declining commodity prices, including oil. Against this backdrop, the monetary policy stances in most advanced and emerging market economies have either remained unchanged or become more accommodative since the previous MPC meeting, with the exception of Brazil where interest rates were increased further. Monetary policies in the advanced economies are likely to remain asynchronous: highly accommodative stances in the Eurozone and Japan are likely to persist for some time, while a start of monetary policy tightening is likely in the US sometime this year, followed by the UK. The rand exchange rate has been relatively volatile and depreciated significantly since the previous meeting of the MPC. The rand, along with a number of other emerging market currencies, has been particularly sensitive to changing global risk perceptions relating to the Greek crisis, the volatility in the Chinese equity markets, declining commodity prices and expectations of the start of US monetary policy tightening. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand traded in a wide band of between R11,82 and R12,58 against the US dollar. Over the period, the rand has depreciated by 5,0 per cent against the US dollar, by 3,6 per cent against the euro and by 3,5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand found some support from the improved current account outcome of 4,8 per cent of GDP in the first quarter of 2015, and the more favourable recent trade data. Whilst these better outcomes may reflect the depreciated real effective exchange rate, further gains are likely to be constrained by the recent decline in commodity 5. Whilst these better outcomes may reflect the depreciated real effective exchange rate, further gains are likely to be constrained by the recent decline in commodity 5 prices. The Bank forecasts a current account deficit of around 4,6 per cent of GDP for the year. Global capital flows have remained relatively volatile against the backdrop of changing risk perceptions. This has been reflected in non-resident bond and equity flows: according to JSE data, non-residents were net sellers of South African government bonds to the value of R12,7 billion in May and June, but were net buyers of equities to the value of R17,7 billion. To date in July, non-residents have been net buyers of equities and bonds to the value of R3,7 billion and R2,4 billion respectively. The rand remains a significant risk factor to the inflation outlook given the vulnerability of the rand and long bond yields to possible US interest rate increases, as well as a deterioration in South Africa's terms of trade. The inflation forecast assumes a relatively stable real effective exchange rate over the forecast period, implying a nominal effective depreciation in line with inflation differentials between South Africa and her major trading partners. A nominal depreciation in excess of this would pose an upside risk to inflation, although this risk could be ameliorated to some extent should the relatively low pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation persist. The extent to which US policy tightening is already priced into the exchange rate also remains uncertain. The domestic growth outlook remains subdued, amid continued electricity supply constraints, and weak business and consumer confidence. Growth in the first quarter of 2015 measured 1,3 per cent, and high frequency data suggest that the second quarter growth is likely to be broadly similar. The Bank's forecast for growth in each 6. The Bank's forecast for growth in each 6 year of the forecast period has been revised down marginally, to 2,0 per cent in 2015 and 2,1 per cent in 2016, and rising to 2,6 per cent in 2017 when some easing of the electricity supply constraint is assumed. However, the risks to growth are still assessed to be moderately on the downside. The recent further decline in the Bank's composite leading business cycle indicator also suggests a continuation of the weak growth outlook. The RMB/BER business confidence index has declined for two consecutive quarters, measuring 43 index points in the second quarter of 2015, with confidence in the manufacturing sector particularly low, at 29 index points. The physical volume of manufacturing production has contracted on a month-on-month basis in three of the first five months of this year, and this sector is expected to record negative growth in the second quarter. Although the PMI improved in May and June, it remains around the 50 index point level, consistent with a constrained outlook. The mining sector, by contrast, has displayed some resilience, particularly in the PGM sub-sector, although the weaker platinum and palladium prices are expected to create further headwinds. Underlying this subdued growth outlook is the persistent weakness in growth in gross fixed capital formation, particularly by the private sector. These trends contributed to a contraction in non-agricultural formal sector employment on both a quarter-on-quarter basis, and a year-on-year basis. During the four quarters to the first quarter of 2015, over 41 000 jobs were shed, of which just over 30 000 were in the private sector. Although consumption expenditure of households improved somewhat in the first quarter of 2015, this was probably induced by temporary factors including the decline 7. Although consumption expenditure of households improved somewhat in the first quarter of 2015, this was probably induced by temporary factors including the decline 7 in the petrol price and lower food price inflation. However, following the increase in personal income taxes alongside higher electricity tariffs and a reversal of the petrol price declines, the outlook for consumption expenditure has deteriorated. This negative outlook is reflected in slowing retail sales growth, declining motor vehicle sales and the continued weak pace in credit extended to households by the banking sector. Tighter affordability criteria as well as proposals to cap interest charges on unsecured loans are likely to constrain bank credit extension to households further. This is in contrast to the continued buoyant growth in credit extension to the corporate sector. Against this backdrop, the FNB/BER consumer confidence index reached a 14-year low in the second quarter of 2015. Notwithstanding the recent moderation in nominal wage growth, the pace of growth remains high and contributes to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Year-on- year growth in nominal salaries and wages per worker moderated to 6,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, from 7,3 per cent in the previous quarter. Adjusting for productivity increases, due in part to employment reductions, labour cost increases declined to 4,1 per cent in the first quarter. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements declined to 7,8 per cent in the first half of 2015, compared with 8,1 per cent in 2014 as a whole. Food prices remain a concern to the MPC, despite the continued moderation of food price inflation at the CPI level having measured 4,6 per cent in May and 4,3 per cent in June. However, the continuing drought in parts of the country has contributed to the upside risk to the outlook, despite benign global food price inflation. Maize and wheat prices have increased significantly since the beginning of the year, and we are 8. Maize and wheat prices have increased significantly since the beginning of the year, and we are 8 yet to see the full impact on consumer prices. At the PPI level, however, cereal and crop price inflation accelerated to 17,8 per cent in May, and both wheat and maize prices are now trading at around import parity levels. International oil prices have been somewhat weaker since the previous meeting of the MPC, following higher output by Saudi Arabia, and the prospects of a resumption of oil exports by Iran. This follows two consecutive months of oil prices in the range of US$60-65 per barrel. Since early July, spot prices have traded below US$60 per barrel, while futures prices are currently trading at around US$58 per barrel for December delivery. The Bank's forecast assumes a moderate increase in oil prices over the forecast period. Domestic petrol prices have increased by about 90 cents per liter in the past two months, but should current trends persist, a price reduction of around 40 cents per litre is likely in August. While the June inflation outcomes were below expectations, this respite is expected to be temporary. The persistence of forecast inflation at elevated levels and the continued upside risks to the outlook remain a concern to the MPC. Although inflation is currently within the target range, given the lags in monetary policy changes on inflation, the focus of policy continues to be on the medium term trend, and to ensure that inflation remains comfortably and sustainably within the target range. Inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range for two quarters, and the medium term trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The upside risks make this trajectory vulnerable to any significant changes in inflation pressures. 9 Although the risks of higher electricity tariffs did not materialise as yet, other upside risks persist. The rand remains vulnerable to global market reaction to US monetary policy normalisation, particularly in the context of South Africa's twin deficits. The pressures on the exchange rate have been exacerbated by the recent significant decline in commodity prices, which are likely to impede the favourable current account adjustment. Some of the rand adjustment has already occurred since the previous meeting, but further reaction to US monetary policy tightening could cause inflation to diverge even further from target, and set in motion an exchange rate- inflation spiral. Further upside risks are expected to come from food prices, which have yet to react to significant increases in spot prices of agricultural commodities. The MPC has indicated for some time that it is in a hiking cycle in response to rising inflation risks, and a normalisation of the policy rate over time. The MPC is cognisant of the fact that domestic inflation is not driven by demand factors, and the outlook for household consumption expenditure remains subdued. Economic growth remains subdued, constrained by electricity supply disruptions and low business and consumer confidence and the risks to the outlook remain on the downside. However, as emphasised previously, we have to be mindful of the risk of second-round effects on inflation, and the committee is concerned that failure to act against these heightened pressures and risks will cause inflation expectations to become entrenched at higher levels. The MPC has therefore decided to continue on its path of gradual policy normalisation. Accordingly, the repurchase rate will increase by 25 basis points to 6,0 per cent per annum with effect from Friday 24 July 2015. Four members 10 favoured a 25 basis point increase, while two members favoured an unchanged stance. The expected inflation trajectory implies that the real repurchase rate remains low and possibly still slightly negative at times, and below its longer term average. The monetary policy stance therefore remains supportive of the domestic economy. The continuing challenge is for monetary policy to achieve a fine balance between achieving our core mandate of price stability and not undermining short term growth unduly. Monetary policy actions will continue to be sensitive, to the extent possible, to the fragile state of the economy. As before, any future moves will therefore be highly data dependent.

Israel,2015-07-27,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor June increased by 0.3 percent, while the average of forecasters' projections was for an increase of 0.2 percent. There was a seasonal increase in the clothing and footwear component and a seasonal decline in thefruit and vegetables component. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.4 percent, similar to the change over the 12 months that ended in May. CPI components representing tradable goods declined by 1.8 percent over the past 12 months, and are still affected by the decline in energy prices that occurred prior to thebeginning of 2015. The growth rate of components representing nontradable items continues to increase, as prices rose by 0.5 percent over the previous 12 months. In March-June, the rate of increase in the CPI has been consistent with achieving the inflation target, but inflation measured over the preceding 12 months is expected to remain negative for several more months. In addition, the decline in energy prices that resumed in the past month, and the appreciation of the shekel, are liable to defer the return of the inflation rate to within the target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Short-term inflation expectations from various sources remained around the lower bound of the inflation target range this month. Similar to the previous month, private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 1 percent, on average, and expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates are for 0.7 percent. Twelve-month ahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market are currently 1.0 percent, and expectations for 2 years are 1.3 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) forward expectations remained around 1.5 percent this month, while expectations for longer terms (5-10 years) continued to range around the midpoint of the inflation target range. The Telbor curve indicates some probability of a reduction in the interest rate in the next few months, but most private forecasters do not expect a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate. Forecasters project the interest rate in 1 yearto be 0.29 percent, on average. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity that became available this month point to the economy continuing to grow at the moderate rate of the past few years, with a decline inexports. In the third estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter. GDP growth was revised slightly downward (from 2.1 percent to 2.0 percent, seasonally adjusted data in annual terms), with a downward revision in exports (a contraction of 2.1 percent compared to a contraction of 1.9 percent in the previous estimate), and an upward revision in private consumption (to 7.9 percent, compared with 7.5 percent). In the Companies Survey for the second quarter, the net weighted balance remained near zero, similar to the first quarter. Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds, in current dollar terms) declined by 5 percent in June, following an increase of 2 percent in May, primarily due to a sharp decline in pharmaceuticals exports following a sharp increase in May. Goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds, and fuels) increased by 6 percent in June. Business services exports (excluding startup companies) increased by 5.9 percent in May compared with April, following a prolonged decline in recent months, while the tourism industry continues to recover very slowly: thenumber of tourist arrivals in the second quarter (seasonally adjusted) wasjust 2 percent higher than in the first quarter. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.4 percent in June, positively affected by the increase in imports and in the job vacancy rate. However, the (continued)decline in goods exports and in industrial production were notably negative aspects among the components. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics increased this month following a decline in the previous month, and the index compiled by Bank Hapoalim has remained stable for the past five months. The Purchasing Managers Index increased to 51.0 points in June. The labor market: Labor market data continue to indicate a high level of employment and activity. The number of employee posts declined by 0.4 percent in April following an increase in the previous month. In February-April, nominal wages increased by 1.5 percent, and real wages increased by 2.3 percent, relative to November-January (seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts for April-June were 7.8 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. The job vacancy rate increased in June to 3.3 percent, seasonally adjusted, further to the increase in May. Budget data: In January-June, the domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was about NIS 0.6 billion. NIS 1.7 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP. Since the beginning of the year, total tax revenues are about NIS 2.7 billion higher than the seasonal path, and nontax revenues are about NIS 2.5 billion lower than the seasonal path. Since the beginning of the year, gross domestic VAT revenuesincreased by about 9.2 percent in real terms, compared with the corresponding period in 2014, against the background of growth in private consumption. Since the beginning of the year, government domestic expenditure has beenabout NIS 4 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on June 21, 2015, through July 24, 2015, the shekel strengthened by about 0.25 percent against the dollar, and by about 3.5 percent against the euro. The shekel strengthened by about 2.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on June 21, 2015 through July 24, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index remained essentially unchanged (a decline of 0.1 percent). Yields in the government bond market increased by up to 12 basis points on the nominal curve and by up to 20 basis points on the CPI-indexed curve. The yield on unindexed bonds with 10 years to maturity increased from about 2.33 percent to around 2.41 percent. There were slight changes along the makam yield curve, and most of the curve was trading at a yield similar to the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained virtuallyunchanged, at about 70 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in June, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 55.7 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 14.3 percent. The credit market: Outstanding debt of the business sector remained stable in May, at about NIS 821 billion. Repayments of NIS 2.7 billion were offset by the net raising of debt through nonbank loans and as a result of the shekel's depreciation against the dollar. In June, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 3.6 billion, higher than the average over the past 12 months (NIS 2.8 billion), and foreign companies continued to issue bonds at a relatively high pace. There were net withdrawals from corporate bond mutual funds and general bond mutual funds totaling about NIS 3.2 billion in June. Corporate bond market spreads declined slightly in June. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 5.8 billion (1.3 percent) in May to about NIS 442 billion, of which outstanding housing debt increased by about NIS 2.5 billion (0.8 percent)to NIS 309 billion. New mortgage volume continued to increase, reaching NIS 7 billion in June. In parallel, the volume of mortgage refinancings: a process by which borrowers improve the terms of their loans against the background of low interest rates and yields: increased to NIS 2.7 billion (Most of which is not included in the volume of new mortgages taken out). In June, mortgage interest rates increased on all indexation tracks, particularly on the variable-rate indexed track (which increased by 0.2 percentage points), and on the fixed-rate unindexed track (which increased by 0.18 percentage points). The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.4 percent in June,and has increased by 2.2 percent over the past 12 months. In April-May, home prices declined by 0.4 percent, and in the 12 months ending inMay, they increased by 3.2 percent, compared with 4.0 percent in the 12 months ending in the previous month. Preliminary data indicate an increase in the number of transactions in May, among all buyer categories, following aseasonal decline in April. However, the annual pace of transactions is notexceptional compared to previous years. The number of new homes sold in May remains high: about 2,400, similar to the number in April: and the stock of homes available for sale remains relatively high. The global economy: Two developments in the global economy were the focus of attention this month: the crisis in Greece and the sharp stock price declines in China: but in bothsituations there was some stabilization toward the end of the period, and financial market volatility remained limited mainly to those two economies. The IMF revised its 2015 global growth projection slightly downward, and its 2016 projection remained unchanged. World trade has been uncharacteristically contracting for several months. In the US, there was a moderate recovery in the second quarter, and assessments are that it did not compensate for the low growth in the first quarter. Nonfarm payrolls increased by more than average for the year to date, and unemployment declined to 5.3 percent, though the labor force participation rate declined and salaries increasedonly moderately. Housing market indices point to vigorous growth, while personal consumption expenditure increased moderately, exports weakened against the background of the strengthening of the dollar, and industrial production expanded moderately. The Fed Chair repeated the assessment that the Federal Reserve is likely to increase the interest rate this year. In the eurozone, the deterioration of the crisis in Greece did not have a marked negative impact on economic activity or on financial markets. The weakening of the euro and the accommodative monetary policy support exports and demand for credit; purchasing managers indices were relatively positive, and consumer confidence indices remained at high levels relative to recent years. Industrial production contracted in May, and unemployment remained high, at 11.1 percent. The agreement with Greece led, for now, to some calm, though itis still not clear to what extent it is sustainable. Japan's economy is showing signs of slowing: industrial production contracted in May andretail sales grew moderately. The Bank of Japan reduced its growth and inflation forecasts, and there is a growing assessment that it will accelerateits expansion plan. China's stock market, which had increased by about 150 percent in the past year, declined sharply this month, and only stabilized, at a level 20 percent below its high, after various government actions. In contrast, indicators of real economic activity were positive, relative to previous months. In emerging markets, generally, a slowdown continues. Inflation remains low in major economies, and interest rates were reduced by several central banks, including those in Sweden. Canada, and China. The price of a barrel of oil declined this month to $56, from $63 in the previous month, and prices of industrial metals declined to a multiyear low. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for August 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within theprice stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, and the exchange rate of the shekel, as well as on monetary policies of major central banks. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The rate of increase in the CPI over the preceding four months has been consistent with the inflation target. Short-term inflation expectations from various sources are around the lower bound of the target range. Expectations for medium and longer terms remain entrenched near the midpoint of the target range. However, the decline in energy prices, which resumed in the past month, and the appreciation of the shekel, may defer the return of the inflation rate to within the target range. C 2B 7 Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month point to the economy continuing to grow at its moderate rate of recent years, led by private consumption and with a decline in exports. The second quarter Companies Survey supports this assessment. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.4 percent in June, and was positively affected by an increase in imports and in the job vacancy rate, butdeclines in goods exports and in industrial production were notably negative components. Labor market data continue to indicate a high level of employment and activity. C 2B 7 Developments in China's economy and the debt crisis in Greece, despite their recent stabilization, continue to pose risksto a global economic recovery. Moderate recovery continues in the US and Europe. While in the US the probability increased of an interest rate rise beginning this year, in Europe the monetary expansion continues, and in several economies the interest rate was reduced. C 2B 7 The shekel strengthened by 2.5 percent in terms of thenominal effective exchange rate this month, and has appreciated by 7.1 percent for the year to date, primarily as a result of the weakening of the euro. The appreciation, and the moderation in growth of world trade, weigh onthe growth of exports and of the tradable sector. C 2B 7 Robust activity in the housing market, both on the supply side and on the demand side, continued this month, and was reflected ina record level of new mortgage volume, and an especially elevated level ofnew home sales. In the past 12 months, home prices have increased by 3.2 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for August 2015 will be published on August 10, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for September 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. August 24, 2015."
United States,2015-07-29,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months. Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown additional improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft. The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

Egypt,2015-07-30,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 30, 2015 In its meeting held on July 30, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 925 percen. Headline CPI declined by 070 percent (m/m) in June compared to an increase of 119 percent in Ma. Accordingly the annual rate decelerated to 1139 percent in June from 1311 percent in May, supported partially by the favorable base effect from the previous yea. The bulk of the monthly decline was driven by the drop in the prices of fresh vegetables, which was partly offset by the increase in the prices of other food item. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 061 percent in June compared to 065 percent in May, while the annual rate remained largely unchanged recording 807 percent in Jun. Upside risks to the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of broad-based declines in international commodity price. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 43 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q2 to record 56 percent (y/y) in the first half of the fiscal year, supported by the record growth witnessed in the first quarte. This comes after the 2013/14 fiscal year real GDP growth recorded 22 percent (y/y. The expansion in economic activity during 2014/2015 Q2 came on the back of the continued growth in the manufacturing sector and the expansion of tourism activities for the second consecutive quarter after several quarters of contractio. This came despite the continuous weakness in the extraction secto. In the meantime, while the widening trade deficit is stalling real GDP growth, investment remained positive for the fourth consecutive quarte. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global economy on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

Ukraine,2015-07-30,"In order to consolidate the positive developments in the money market and upheld the disinflation trend, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine decided to leave the discount rate unchanged at 30%. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine held on July 30, 2015, which focused on the monetary policy issues. The meeting discussed the macroeconomic situation, the situation in the money market, the outlook for the further development of the situation and possible changes in the monetary instruments. The Board members pointed to a gradual easing in inflationary pressure. In June, headline inflation continued to slow down  the consumer price index was up by 0.4% in June, compared to an increase of 2.2% in the previous month. The rate of core inflation also moderated to 0.4% in June (compared to 4.6% in April and 1.9% in May). The more balanced foreign exchange market was among the factors which contributed to containing price dynamics. In July, as was the case in the previous two months, the demand for foreign exchange was lower than the supply of foreign exchange in the interbank and cash segments of the foreign exchange market. Therefore, the UAH/USD exchange rate fluctuated within a narrow range. Commenting on the current situation in the money market Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine Valeria Gontareva said: “The positive developments that we observe prove the efficiency of the NBU stabilizing measures. The money market is currently balanced, and if this equilibrium is maintained  we expect the headline inflation to decelerate further. Should inflationary risks keep decreasing, the National Bank of Ukraine will start easing its monetary policy in the nearest future”."
Russia,2015-07-31,"On 31 July 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 11.50 to 11.00 per cent per annum, taking into account that the balance of risks shifts towards the considerable economy cooling despite a slight increase in inflation risks. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, consumer price growth will continue to slow amid slack domestic demand. Annual inflation will fall below 7% in July 2016 and reach the 4% target in 2017. The Bank of Russia will further decide on its key rate depending on the balance of inflation risks and risks of economy cooling. Annual inflation temporarily accelerated in July, which was expected and caused by a greater increase in utility tariffs compared with 2014. As of 27 July 2015, annual consumer price growth rate rose to 15.8% from 15.3% in June, according to Bank of Russia estimates. Weekly inflation declined to 0.0 — 0.1% again after a significant increase early this month. Amid a considerable reduction in real income slack consumer demand hampers consumer price growth. Relatively tough monetary conditions also contain prices. Money supply (М2) growth rate remains low. Lending and deposit rates show downward trends under the influence of earlier Bank of Russia decisions to reduce the key rate. However, they still remain high, on the one hand, contributing to attractiveness of ruble savings, and, on the other hand, alongside with high debt burden and tighter borrower and collateral requirements, resulting in lower annual lending growth. Major macroeconomic indicators demonstrate further economy cooling. The Bank of Russia estimates GDP decrease in 2015 Q2 compared with the similar quarter last year to be more significant than that in Q1 2015. Though structural factors continue hampering the economic growth, output contraction is having cyclical nature. Low consumer and business confidence as well as decreased capacity and labour force utilisation are indicative of this. However, unemployment remains low amid the negative demographic trends, while the labour market adjusts to the new conditions largely through wage decrease and growing part-time employment. These factors along with the decline in retail lending will result in further contraction of consumer spending. Fixed capital investments will continue to contract due to economic agents' negative expectations with regard to the Russian economic outlook and tighter lending conditions. Poor substitution of external funding sources with domestic ones caused by shallow Russian financial market and high debt burden will also contain investment demand. Implementation of government anti-recession measures will facilitate investments. Sluggish investor and consumer activity will result in low demand for imports. Export decline will be less considerable given the floating exchange rate. As a result, net exports will be the only component to make a positive contribution to annual output growth. Due to a more significant domestic demand shrank than that expected in the first half of 2015, the output forecast may be revised downwards. The economic situation in Russia will further depend on the dynamics of world energy prices and the economy's ability to adapt to external shocks. At the same time the scenario with oil prices remaining below US$60 per barrel for a long time is more probable than it was in June. Slack domestic demand will facilitate the continuation of annual inflation reduction in years 2015-2017. A slowdown in consumer price growth will make room for inflation expectations decrease. In early 2016, annual inflation is expected to decelerate considerably due to high base of 2015. According to Bank of Russia forecasts, in July 2016, annual consumer price growth will stand at below 7% to reach the 4% target in 2017. Inflation risks arise mostly from aggravated external economic situation, enhanced inflation expectations, revision of increases in administered prices and tariffs, of payments indexation for 2016-2017, and fiscal policy easing in general. The Bank of Russia will further decide on its key rate depending on the balance of inflation risks and risks of economy cooling. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 11 September 2015.

India,2015-08-04,"Third Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2015-16 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.25 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 14-day term repos as well as longer term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.25 per cent Assessment 2. Since our last statement, global economic activity has recovered modestly in Q2 of calendar 2015. The US economy rebounded on stronger consumption growth and steadily improving labour market conditions, though recent wage data suggest continuing slack. The Euro area has grown at a moderate pace through the first half of 2015, supported by consumer spending, easing financing conditions and a modest downturn in still-high unemployment. In Japan, growth slowed in Q2 after an upside surprise in Q1. Domestic consumption is still weak, but manufacturing activity picked up in July and strengthening exports and corporate profitability could stimulate capital spending in H2. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), activity decelerated through H1 due to headwinds from weak external demand, tightening external financing conditions, deteriorating structural bottlenecks and spill overs from unsettled conditions in financial markets. Despite aggressive policy stimuli, the Chinese economy is slowing on macroeconomic rebalancing, sizable stock market corrections, a cooling property market and excess capacity in several manufacturing industries. Manufacturing activity weakened further in July, clouding near-term expectations. Recessionary conditions persist in both Russia and Brazil, with downside risks from commodity prices and geopolitical developments casting a shadow on the outlook, including for other EMEs.2 3. In recent months, financial markets have experienced high turbulence due to the Greek crisis, the Chinese stock market slump and shifts between risk-on and risk- off sentiments based on changes in beliefs about when the Federal Reserve will start raising rates. Bond market sell-offs originating in Germany lifted bond yields across the world, including in EMEs, and tightened financing conditions. Equity markets were buoyed by the search for yields which stretched asset valuations until end-June, when sharp stock market corrections in China pulled down share prices globally. Currency markets were dominated by the rising US dollar, which impacted foreign currency borrowing exposures, increased exchange rate volatility and also produced sizable capital outflows from EMEs. Investors have reduced exposures to EMEs as an asset class, but a generalised flight to safety is yet to be seen. Investors have also shunned commodities affected by the Chinese slowdown, including bullion. In India, the economic recovery is still work in progress. After strong rainfall in June. July has been below par, but on net, the monsoon is near normal. Higher reservoir levels also auger well for the prospects of kharif output, particularly for areas that are dependent on irrigation. Consequently, kharif sowing has expanded significantly relative to a year ago, especially in respect of oilseeds, pulses, rice and coarse cereals. These developments, supported by contingency plans for vulnerable districts, provide cushion against adverse weather shocks. If prospects of a good harvest strengthen, currently weak rural demand will improve to provide an important boost to activity. Shrinking exports in some industries, in part a result of weak global demand and global overcapacity in those industries and in part a result of the significant depreciation of currencies of some major trading partners against the rupee, also contributed to weak aggregate demand. The Reserve Bank's survey- based indicators point to flat capacity utilisation and new orders, with corporate sales growth declining  although lower inflation explains some of the compression in top lines. Although overall business confidence is positive, the level of optimism was a shade lower in April-June than in the preceding quarter. Investment, as measured by new projects, is still weak, primarily because of still-low capacity utilization. In the critically important power sector, where final demand is strong, the recent step-up in generation in response to the commendable easing of bottlenecks in coal supply is being partly negated by structural problems relating to clogging of transmission grids and the dire financial state of electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs). However, there are signs that consumption demand, especially in urban areas, is picking up. Car sales for July were strong. Nominal bank credit growth is lower than previous years, but adjusted for lower inflation as well as for lower borrowing by oil marketing companies and increased borrowing from commercial paper markets, credit availability seems to be adequate for most sectors. The services sector continues to emit mixed signals. The pick-up in heavy commercial vehicle sales and rising port and domestic air freight in Q1 suggest strengthening transportation activity (for Indian data. Q refers to fiscal year quarters). Purchasing managers' indices were in contraction zone in June, mainly due to lower new and existing business conditions. Survey-based expectations of the outlook for the services sector point to positive sentiment in Q2 on the back of an expected increase in turnover and profit margin. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose for the second successive month in June 2015 to a nine-month high on the back of a broad based increase in upside pressures, belying consensus expectations. The sharp month-on-month increase in food and non-food items overwhelmed the sizable ‘base effect' in that month. Food inflation rose 60 basis points over the preceding month, driven by a spike in prices of vegetables, protein items - especially pulses, meat and milk - and spices.3 8. Furthermore, excluding food and fuel, inflation rose in respect of all sub- groups other than housing. The momentum of price increases remained high for education. Inflation pressures increased for personal care and effects and household goods and services sub-groups. Inflation in CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel has been rising steadily since April and exceeded headline inflation through Q1. Near-term inflation expectations of households returned to double digits after two quarters, although those of professional forecasters remained anchored. Rural wage growth was moderate but there are indications of incipient pressures from corporate staff costs. Liquidity conditions have been very easy in June and July. A seasonal reduction in demand for currency and increased spending by Government coupled with structural factors such as low credit deployment relative to the volume of deposit mobilisation contributed to surplus conditions in the money markets. This resulted in a significantly lower average daily net liquidity injection under the fixed rate repos under LAF, and variable rate term repo/reverse repo and MSF at 477 billion in June, down from 1031 billion in May. In July there was net absorption of 120 billion through these facilities. In response to the reduction in the policy repo rate in June the weighted average call rate eased from 7.47 per cent in May to 7.11 per cent in June. The Reserve Bank also conducted open market sales worth 83 billion in the second week of July, essentially in response to lack of demand for longer duration reverse repos. The call money rate remained below the repo rate through July, reflecting comfortable liquidity conditions. Headwinds from weak global demand conditions restrained merchandise exports. The contraction in exports in Q1 of 2015-16, both volume and value, was the steepest since Q2 of 2009-10. The sharp fall in international commodity prices - especially crude oil - compressed import payments, helping to narrow the trade deficit. Domestic production shortages and lower international prices were, however, evident in higher imports of electronic goods, pulses, iron ore and fertilisers. Net surpluses on account of trade in services were sustained in Q1 and have, along with the lower trade deficit, helped reduce the current account deficit (CAD). Despite slowing portfolio flows, other forms of foreign capital flows such as foreign direct investment and non-resident deposits were sustained. With the shrinking external financing requirement, reserves were built up to an all-time high at the end of June, providing a buffer against adverse global shocks. Policy Stance and Rationale 11. The bi-monthly policy statements of April and June indicated that the accommodative stance of monetary policy will be maintained going forward, but monetary policy actions will be conditioned by (a) fuller transmission by banks of the Reserve Bank's front-loaded rate reductions into their lending rates; (b) developments in food prices and their management, especially the effects of the monsoon, while looking through both seasonal as well as base effects; (c) a continuation and even acceleration of policy efforts to unclog the supply side so as to make available key inputs such as power and land, as also repurposing of public spending from poorly targeted subsidies towards public investment and reducing the pipeline of stalled investment; and (d) signs of normalisation of the US monetary policy. In the June statement, it was pointed out that a targeted infusion of bank capital is also warranted so that adequate credit flows to the productive sectors as investment picks up. Since the first rate cut in January, the median base lending rates of banks has fallen by around 30 basis points, a fraction of the 75 basis points in rate cut so far. As loan demand picks up in Q3 of 2015-16, banks will see more gains from cutting rates4 to secure new lending, and more transmission will take place. The welcome announcement by Government of infusion of bank capital into public sector banks will help loan growth and hence transmission, as will currently easy liquidity conditions. During 2015-16 so far, inflation conditions have evolved around the path projected in April and June bi-monthly policy statements, though they surprised somewhat on the upside in June. Large base effects, which the Reserve Bank will look through, are expected to pull down headline inflation in July and August. From September, favourable base effects wane. Turning to the balance of inflation risks, most worrisome is the sustained hardening of inflation excluding food and fuel. Moreover, the full effects of the service tax increase, which took effect from June, will feed through over the rest of the year. Some food prices, particularly of protein-rich items, pulses and oilseeds have risen sharply in recent months. They will have to be carefully monitored as they tend to be sticky and impart an upward bias to inflation and inflation expectations. This assumes significance in view of households' inflation expectations rising again. Several factors, however, could have a significant mitigating influence. These include the sharp fall in crude prices since June and the likelihood of this softness persisting in view of the global supply glut and expanding production by Iran; the welcome increase in planting of pulses and oilseeds and prospects of rainfall in August and September according to some forecasters; the effects of the Government's current pro-active supply management to contain shocks to food prices, especially of vegetables, alongside its decision to keep increases in minimum support prices moderate. Relative to the projections of the second bi-monthly statement, inflation projections in this bi-monthly statement are elevated by the higher than expected June observation but reduced by prospects of softer crude prices and a near-normal monsoon thus far. This implies that inflation projections for January-March 2016 are lower by about 0.2 per cent, with risks broadly balanced around the target of 6.0 per cent for January 2016 (Chart 1). Taking into account all this, and given that policy action was front-loaded in June, it is prudent to keep the policy rate unchanged at the current juncture while maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Short term real risk free rates are nevertheless supportive of borrowing by interest rate sensitive consumer segments such as housing and automobiles. Significant uncertainty will be resolved in the coming months, including the likely persistence of recent inflationary pressures, the full monsoon outturn, as well as possible Federal Reserve actions. As the5 Reserve Bank awaits greater transmission of its front-loaded past actions, it will monitor developments for emerging room for more accommodation. The outlook for growth is improving gradually. Favourable real income effects could accrue from weaker commodity prices, in particular crude oil, and a possible step-up in agricultural activity if monsoon conditions continue to improve. On the other hand, global growth projections for 2015 have generally been revised downwards and, therefore, the export contraction could become a prolonged drag on growth going forward. Notwithstanding some improvement in the state of stalled projects, supply constraints continue to be binding and new investment demand emanating from the private sector and the central Government remains subdued. On an assessment of the evolving balance of risks, the projected output growth for 2015- 16 has been retained at 7.6 per cent (Chart 2). The fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on September 29, 2015. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2015-2016/297 Principal Chief General Manager."
Romania,2015-08-04,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the new quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for 6 August 2015. The latest statistical data confirm the fall of annual inflation rate into negative territory under the impact of broadening, as of 1 June 2015, the scope of the reduced VAT rate to all food items and public food services. In the same period, economic growth gained momentum, driven by the substantial pick-up in final consumption and by the positive investment dynamics, also against the backdrop of the recovery in lending. In June 2015, the annual inflation rate slipped to -1.6 percent, from 1.2 percent in the previous month. The disinflationary shock which has stemmed from the first-round effects of the cut in the VAT rate on food items, to 9 percent from 24 percent, and which has impacted the prices of nearly 30 percent of the goods and services included in the consumer basket was stronger than expected. Statistical data show that food prices for which the VAT rate was cut have fallen by 9.8 percent in June versus May. The average annual inflation rate dropped to 0.7 percent and the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, went down to 1.0 percent, from 1.1 percent. Monetary indicators reveal the real annual rate of change of credit to the private sector returning to positive territory, given the expansion in domestic currency loans (up by a real 15 percent year on year in June 2015), amid gradual easing of the monetary policy stance over the past year via the entire range of tools: policy rate cuts, narrowing of the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate, reduction in minimum reserve requirements ratios and adequate liquidity management. The stock of forex loans kept narrowing, with their share in total credit to the private sector reaching 52.4 percent in June 2015, compared to a peak of 64.4 percent in May 2012. This development is beneficial in terms of strengthening the monetary policy transmission and mitigating the risks to financial stability. At global level, the recent period is characterised by still tepid economic recovery and heightened volatility on foreign financial markets, amid the protracted uncertainty relating to the situation in Greece, the economic picture in China, and the diverging monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks. On the domestic front, the authorities envisage implementing a number of fiscal policy measures (the package of fiscal easing measures and the updated unified wage law) that have a direct impact on macroeconomic stability and the economic policy mix agreed upon with international institutions under the external financial arrangements. All these factors, which are likely to affect the global appetite for risk and investor perception regarding the Romanian economy, weigh on the management of domestic macroeconomic policies. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report. Compared to the previous forecast, the updated quarterly projection implies a new substantial revision of the expected path of the annual inflation rate, following the incorporation of the anticipated impact of the fiscal measures recently adopted by Parliament and currently under re-examination. The new forecast shows the annual inflation rate sticking to negative values over the next three quarters, before returning into positive territory, but below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target, until the beginning of 2017. However, the strengthening over the short term of the transitory disinflationary impact exerted by the aforementioned fiscal measures masks the build-up of medium-term inflationary pressures, given the faster closing of the negative output gap, followed by the gradual widening of excess demand, along with the pick-up in unit labour costs. The risks to the inflation outlook stem from both external and domestic developments, relating mainly to the uncertainty about the economic policies in the period ahead and the relations with the international financial institutions. Under the circumstances and based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board is restating that its decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term in a manner supportive of economic growth within a sustainable macroeconomic environment, while safeguarding financial stability. To this end, it is necessary for the fiscal policy measures pending implementation not to jeopardise macroeconomic stability, which is an extremely important public asset underlying the currently favourable sentiment towards Romania. The consistent implementation of an adequate monetary and fiscal policy mix and the progress in structural reforms are pivotal to preserving macroeconomic equilibria, ensuring lasting economic growth, further convergence with the European Union, as well as to enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to potential shocks or adverse conditions worldwide. The NBR reiterates that it monitors on an ongoing basis both domestic developments and the international economic environment so as  via the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools  to ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 6 August 2015. In line with the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 30 September 2015.  Video: Press briefing, 4 August 2015 (Romanian only)."
Czech Republic,2015-08-06,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. Despite an expected increase, it will remain below the target at the monetary policy horizon. According to the forecast, sustainable fulfilment of this target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will not occur until early 2017. A need to maintain significantly expansionary monetary conditions therefore persists. In this respect, the recent exchange rate appreciation is thus an unfavourable factor that is tightening the monetary conditions and hence postponing achievement of the inflation target. In this situation, the Bank Board emphasised that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the second half of 2016. The exchange rate will therefore be at CZK 27 to the euro or weaker at least until mid-2016. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate at the forecast horizon to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to domestic prices and other nominal variables. As regards the assumptions of the forecast regarding the external environment, growth in economic activity in the euro area should accelerate towards 2% this year and reach similar levels in the following two years. Industrial producer prices in the euro area are falling sharply year on year and consumer price inflation is still close to zero. At the start of this year, the European Central Bank responded to the subdued inflation by further easing monetary policy. This is reflected in the outlook for three-month Euribor rates, which is close to zero until the end of next year. Both producer and consumer prices are expected to start rising gradually thanks to the ECB's easy monetary policy, a weakened exchange rate of the euro and an increase in the growth rate of the euro area economies. This will also be fostered by the fading effect of the fall in oil prices recorded in late 2014 and early 2015. According to market outlooks, the price of Brent crude oil will rise slowly after decreasing in late 2014 and early 2015. This outlook has been revised downwards slightly over the entire horizon compared to the previous forecast. In addition, oil prices have fallen towards USD 50 a barrel in recent days. Koruna prices of energy will also be affected by the outlook for a gradually weakening euro-dollar exchange rate until early 2017. Headline inflation increased in 2015 Q2. This increase was chiefly due to food prices, which returned to annual growth. The anti-inflationary effect of import prices, amplified by the recent appreciation of the koruna against the euro, will subside gradually, and import prices will be slightly inflationary in the second half of next year. The domestic economy will foster higher consumer prices over the entire forecast horizon via accelerating wage growth. However, inflation will dip temporarily as this year's one-off effects dissipate in 2016 Q2 and Q3. Headline inflation will thus still be below the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon and will not hit the target until 2017. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will be slightly lower than headline inflation owing to positive first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes stemming from further increases in excise duty on tobacco products. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will thus also be below the CNB's 2% target at the monetary policy horizon, approaching the target from below in 2017. The Czech economy expanded by 4% year on year in 2015 Q1, with all domestic demand components making positive contributions. By contrast, the contribution of net exports was negative. The output gap is thus closing gradually, but remains negative. The robust economic growth will continue. However, the forecast predicts a correction of the annual GDP growth rate in 2015 Q2 amid a modest quarter-on-quarter decline in economic activity linked with an expected fall in inventories. Accelerating external demand, low oil prices, easy domestic monetary conditions and higher government investment will lead to GDP growth of 3.8% this year. Economic growth will slow below 3% next year, reflecting the unwinding of the effect of an extraordinary increase in inventories at the start of this year as well as a fall in oil prices. A decline in government investment and the recent appreciation of the koruna-euro exchange rate will also foster an economic slowdown. According to the forecast, the economy will maintain the same rate of growth in 2017, with positive contributions from all components of domestic demand and, to a small extent, also from net exports. The rising economic activity will manifest itself in a further improvement in the labour market situation. The number of employees converted into full-time equivalents will continue to rise and unemployment will decrease further. Wage growth in the business sector will increase noticeably and wages in the non-business sector will rise at a stable rate. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates amid modest appreciation of the koruna in 2017. Compared to the previous forecast, the predictions for headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation are higher until mid-2016 owing to higher observed inflation, a smaller decrease in administered prices expected in the near future and stronger growth of the Czech economy. By contrast, the recent appreciation of the koruna towards the level of the exchange rate commitment is having a downward effect on the inflation forecast. The appreciation is affecting the inflation outlook in the longer term as well. A lower prediction for administered prices next year is acting in the same direction. Expected inflation is thus slightly lower at the monetary policy horizon compared to the previous forecast. Stronger economic growth in 2015 Q1 and a faster labour market recovery have led to a marked upward revision of GDP growth this year. By contrast, the prediction for 2016 is slightly lower on account of the unwinding of the effect of an extraordinary increase in inventories this year and the recent appreciation of the koruna against the euro. The assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016 is unchanged."
Georgia,2015-08-12,"12.08.15 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 0.5 Percentage Points to 6.0%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on August 12, 2015 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 6.0 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, which indicates increase in the inflation expectations as well as in the domestic and external risks affecting the forecast inflation. Aggregate demand is still weak due to the negative economic developments in our main trading partners. Domestically a factor worth mentioning is the attempt to discredit the policy of the National Bank, which pushes up long term interest rates, weakens the monetary policy transmission efficiency and drives up inflation expectations. In line with the existing forecast the Monetary Policy Committee considers appropriate to continue normalization of the monetary policy. Unless additional shocks occur, the monetary policy rate by the end of the year will be within 6.5 percent. The rate of further changes in the monetary policy will depend on the inflation forecast. According to existing forecasts, due to the one-time factors the inflation might slightly overshoot its 5% target value by the end of 2015. The annual growth in consumer prices equaled 4.9% in July, getting close to the 5% target value set by the National Bank. The main factors causing rise in inflation was the increase in the intermediate costs of production due to exchange rate depreciation and higher prices on certain imported goods. The rise in inflation has been limited by the weak aggregate demand and decrease in the world prices of oil and food products. According to preliminary information the real GDP growth in the second quarter was consistent with the forecasts. The factor hindering the growth is the external sector, which, given the dire economic situation in the region negatively affects the export of goods and services. The domestic demand has also weakened, as a result of the decline in remittances and increase in the service burden of foreign currency denominated loans. There have been some positive developments in relation to the elimination of external imbalance. Given the decrease in foreign currency remittances the change in the exchange rate has caused import to adjust. In the second quarter import has decreased by 21 percent (not taking into account the import of hepatitis C treatment medications, funded through the grant). Accordingly we can assume that the impact of the existing external shock on the exchange rate has been exhausted. Other things equal no additional pressure can be expected on the exchange rate coming from the existing external shock. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 23, 2015."
Philippines,2015-08-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that prevailing price and output conditions support maintaining current monetary policy settings. Latest baseline forecasts show that inflation could settle slightly below the target range for 2015 but is likely to remain within the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point over the rest of the policy horizon. Inflation expectations also continue to be anchored within the inflation target band. Meanwhile, the Monetary Board noted the upside risks coming from pending petitions for power rate adjustments and the impact of stronger-than-expected El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates. On the other hand, modest rise in food and commodity prices, and slower global economic activity could pose downside risks to inflation. In deciding to keep the BSP's monetary policy settings unchanged, the Monetary Board observed that the recent benign inflation outturns have been the result of favorable supply-side conditions, which are seen as largely transitory. Over the policy horizon, inflation is projected to rise gradually and stabilize within the lower half of the inflation target range. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that recent developments on the global front require careful monitoring, as they could pose threats to financial stability. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriately calibrated at this time. The BSP will continue to keep a watchful eye on domestic and external conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance stays in line with maintaining price and financial stability."
Chile,2015-08-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 August 2015 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, financial markets remain highly volatile. Emerging country currencies have depreciated further and risk premiums have increased. The outlook for global growth has deteriorated slightly and developments in China have increased risks, especially for commodity exporting economies. The prices of both copper and fuels dropped again. Domestically, annual CPI variation is still above 4% and is expected to stay in that level for longer than previously thought. One year ahead, market expectations increased again, but two years ahead remained unchanged. The evolution of inflation expectations will continue to be monitored with special attention. Meanwhile, output and demand continue to be weaker than assumed in the Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario, and private growth expectations for this and next year dropped further. Confidence indicators have turned more pessimistic. Private job creation and annual wage growth show no material change from last month. The peso has depreciated. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2015-08-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well. Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility due to a shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy and to the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have continued their trend of decline but consumption and the sentiments of economic agents, after having contracted due mainly to the shock from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, appear to have improved. On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio in July maintained the same level as that during July of last year, but the trend of increase in the number of persons employed slowed and, due mainly to an expansion in job search activities, the unemployment rate rose compared to that in July last year. The Committee forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of recovery going forward, owing chiefly to the expansionary macroeconomic policies and to the ending of the MERS outbreak, but judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Despite cuts in electricity fees, consumer price inflation registered 0.7% in July, the same as in June, in line mainly with expansions in the extents of increase in service prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices was 2.0% in July, also the same as in June. Looking ahead the Committee forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, influenced mostly by expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and by the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won has depreciated sharply against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Long-term market interest rates have fallen slightly, in response mainly to interest rate movements in major countries. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as any shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the financial instabilities in some emerging economies, as well as the trends of capital flows."
Peru,2015-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2015 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the target range in the 2015-2016 forecast horizon and takes into account that: economic activity is recovering, but continues growing at levels below its potential level; inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors, such as foreign exchange depreciation and the rise of the prices of some food products, fuels, and utility rates. The Board's decision also takes into account that: inflation expectations have increased, reaching similar rates to the upper bank of the inflation target range, and international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as high volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets. Inflation in July showed a rate of 0.45 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.54 percent in June to 3.56 percent in July. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in electricity rates (2.9 percent), water rates (5.3 percent), urban fares (0.7 percent), and domestic transportation (16.0 percent). Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.59 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.0 percent in June to 3.36 percent in July. Inflation is expected to show a rate of 3.15 percent at end-2015 and a rate of 2.95 percent at end-2016. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations continue showing an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and stands ready, should it be necessary, to make adjustments in its monetary policy rate to lead inflation to the target range in the horizon of monetary policy effectiveness. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.00 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on September 10, 2015."
Turkiye,2015-08-18," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.25 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while domestic demand contributes to growth moderately. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Processed food and energy price developments affect inflation favorably in the short run, while exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering this delay and taking into account the uncertainty in domestic and global markets and the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to implement a tighter liquidity policy as long as deemed necessary. Moreover, the Committee also discussed the roadmap to be implemented before and after global monetary policy normalization and decided to publish a strategy document with today's policy statement. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Colombia,2015-08-21,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica in today's meeting decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5%. This decision took into account mainly the following aspects. In July, annual consumer inflation increased slightly, reaching 4.46%. The average of the four measures of core inflation rose for the tenth month in a row, registering at 4.29%. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years and those embedded in public debt to 2, 3 and 5 years increased and continue in the upper half of the target range. The pass-through of nominal depreciation to consumer prices and the increase in the cost of imported raw materials, as well as the lower dynamics in food supply, explain in great part the acceleration of inflation so far this year. The pass-through of part of the devaluation of the peso to consumer prices and the persistence of El Nino can delay the convergence of inflation to the target, both by their direct impact on prices and inflation expectations and through the activation of indexing mechanisms. The figures of global economic activity continue reflecting a weak external demand, lower to the one recorded in 2014. In the United States and the euro zone, economy continues to recover, but at rates somewhat lower than anticipated. In China, economic activity continues slowing down, and the major economies in Latin America registered low growth or contractions of their output. The risk of a greater economic slowdown in China and the unexpected devaluation of the yuan generated volatility in global financial markets and in the prices of some commodities. The US dollar continues to strengthen and it is expected that the Federal Reserve of the United States will increase its interest rate during the remaining of this year. The international price of oil exhibited a significant decrease and the prices of several commodities imported by Colombia stopped falling. Should these levels in the prices of exports and imports continue, the terms of trade and the national income would fall more than expected. This largely explains the strong devaluation of the peso vis--vis the US dollar as compared with other countries' currencies. In Colombia, for the second quarter, the indicators of retail trade, consumer and retail confidence, and economic expectations indicate that domestic demand continues to weaken. The industry contracted and construction indicators suggest a slowdown in the sector. Data for July show a fall in oil production, while that of coffee increased. Considering this, and given the developments observed in the external demand for domestic goods and services, the technical staff maintained the estimate of economic growth for all of 2015 within a range of 1.8% and 3.4%, with 2.8%, as the most likely outcome. In all, inflation remains above the upper limit of the target range and domestic expenditure of the economy continues adjusting to the lower dynamics of national income. Projections indicate that in the monetary policy horizon, the temporary price shocks will be reversed and the probable excesses of capacity will contribute to inflation converging to the target in an environment of anchored inflation expectations. However, the partial pass-through of the devaluation of the peso to prices and an eventual intensification of El Nino could delay such convergence. The Board will continue monitoring carefully the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as those of asset markets and the international situation. It also reiterates that the course of monetary policy will depend on the information available."
Israel,2015-08-24,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor July increased by 0.2 percent, similar to the average of forecasters' projections. There was a notable seasonal increase in the fruit and vegetables component (1.1 percent), and the housing component increased by 1 percent. There was a marked seasonal decline in the clothing and footwear component (6.6 percent). The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.3 percent, compared to negative 0.4 percent over the over the 12 months that ended in June. Pricesof CPI components representing tradable goods declined by 1.5 percent overthe past 12 months, compared with a decline of 1.8 percent over the 12 months ended in June, and are still affected by the decline in energy prices that occurred prior to the beginning of 2015. The prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 0.5 percent over the preceding 12 months, similar to the figure last month. The rate of increase in the CPI in recent months has been consistent with achieving the inflation target, but the decline in energy and commodity prices that resumed in the past two months is expected to delay the return of the inflation rate to within the target range. This possibility was noted as one of the risks to the staff forecast published by the Research Department at the end of June. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Energy and commodity price declines led to a lowering of inflation expectations worldwide. In Israel, as well, there was a sharp decline this month in short-term inflation expectations from various sources. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined from 1 percent to 0.7 percent, on average, and expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates declined from 0.7 percent to 0.35 percent. Twelve-month ahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined aswell, from 1.0 percent to 0.6 percent, while expectations for 2 years declined from 1.3 percent last month to 0.9 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) forward expectations remained around 1.5 percent this month, while expectations for longer terms (5-10 years) continued to range around the midpoint of the inflation target range: reflecting the short term aspect of the factors in the decline of short term expectations. The Telbor curve indicates some probability of a reduction in the interest rate in the next few months, but most private forecasters do not expect such a reduction. Forecasters' projection of the interest rate in 1 year remains 0.29 percent, on average. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity that became available this month point to some decline in the rate of growth, relative to its range of 2.5-3.0 percent over the past two years, against the background of the moderation in world trade. In the past year. National Accounts data have seen considerable fluctuationand marked revisions against the background of one-off factors. In the first estimate of second quarter data. GDP growth was only 0.3 percent (seasonally adjusted National Accounts data, in annual terms), and business sectorproduct contracted by 1 percent. Goods and services exports (excluding diamonds and startup companies) contracted by 11.6 percent (impacted by, amongother things, labor disruptions in the chemicals industry), fixed capital formation (excluding ships and aircraft) contracted by 0.6 percent, and public consumption (excluding defense imports) increased by 2.7 percent. Private consumption, which led growth in previous quarters, increased by only 0.9 percent, due to a decline in durable goods purchases as vehicle acquisitions had been brought forward to the end of 2014. Private current consumption increased by 4.6 percent. The industrial production index increased by 4.6 percent in June (seasonally adjusted), after declining in April and May, and there was a moderate increase in trade and services revenue. Foreign trade data for July indicate an increase of 9.8 percent in manufactured goodsexports, excluding diamonds (data in current dollar terms), against the background of a sharp increase in chemicals exports in light of the cessationof labor disruptions, and an increase of 0.4 percent in imports (excludingships and aircraft, diamonds, and fuels). Business services exports (excluding startups) declined by 3.4 percent in June, and have not grown for about the past year and a half. In the tourism industry, some acceleration is apparent in the rate of recovery: the number of tourist arrivals (seasonally adjusted) in May-July was 3.6 percent higher than in February-April, but it is still markedly lower than the figure in the period preceding Operation Protective Edge. The Climate Index indicates that the monthly growth rate stabilized between January and July at around 0.23-0.26 percent. Consumer Confidence indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and by Bank Hapoalim declined slightly this month, andthe Purchasing Managers Index declined to 47.2 points. The labor market: The number of employedpersons continued to expand in the second quarter, but the expansion halted in July, with slight declines in the labor force participation rate, to 79.6 percent, and in the employment rate, to 76.0 percent, among the prime working ages (25-64), and a slight increase in the unemployment ratein that age group to 4.6 percent. The growth in employment encompasses thepublic and private services sectors, while in manufacturing and infrastructure it halted at the beginning of 2014. Nominal wages increased by 1.1 percent, and real wages increased by 1.6 percent, in March-May, relative to December-February (seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts for May-July were about 5.5 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period of the previous year. The job vacancy ratestabilized at a high level of 3.2 percent in May-July. Budget data: The budget for 2015-16 was approved by the government, with a deficit target of 2.9 percent.In January-July, the domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was about NIS 0.8 billion. Since the beginning of the year, total tax revenues are about NIS 3.8 billion greater than the seasonal path consistent with projected revenue, against the background of high revenue from real estate, vehicle and capital gains taxes. Since the beginning of the year, gross domestic VAT revenues increased by about 5.4 percent in real terms, compared with the corresponding period in 2014. For the year to date, government domestic expenditure is about 3.4 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on July 26, 2015, through August 21, 2015, the shekel weakened by about 1.3 percent against the dollar, and by about 4.2 percent against the euro. The shekel weakened by about 1.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on July 26, 2015, through August 21, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 0.4 percent. Government bond yields declined by about 10 basis points on the nominal curve, and on the CPI-indexed curve they increased by up to 50 basis points for short terms and by about 10 basis points for other maturities. The yield on unindexed bonds with 10 years to maturity declined from about 2.28 percent to around 2.16 percent. There were slight changes along the makam yield curve, and most of the curve was trading at a yield similar to the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread,remained virtually unchanged, at about 72 basis points. On August 23, 2015, there were marked fluctuations in financial markets, with the Tel Aviv 25 Index declining by 4.1 percent, following the fluctuations abroad in the preceding days. Nominal yields declined in the government bond market by up to 6 basis points, and real short term yields increased by up to 11 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in July, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 55.0 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 13.9 percent. The credit market: In July, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 1.3 billion in bonds, lower than the average over the past 12 months (about NIS 2.3 billion). Most of the issueswere by companies in the real estate industry. Net new investment in corporate bond mutual funds resumed in July and continued in August, with a decline in corporate bond market spreads. New mortgage volume remained high, totaling about NIS 6.6 billion in July. The share of mortgages granted for the purchaseof an investment home was lower in May and June than in preceding months. In July, similar to June, mortgage interest rates increased on all indexation tracks, increasing by 0.2 percentage points on the fixed-rate and variable rate CPI-indexed tracks and by 0.3 percentage points on the fixed-rate unindexed track. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 1 percent in July, and has increased by 2.3 percent over the past 12 months. In May-June, home prices increased by 0.8 percent, and in the 12 months ending in June, they increased by 4.4 percent, compared with 3.4 percent in the 12 months ending in the previous month. Preliminary data indicate that the number of transactions in June remained at the relatively high level of recent months, and that there was an increase in the number of transactions by investors, apparently in order to precede the purchase tax increase decided on forsuch transactions. The number of new homes sold in June reached a record high: about 2,500: and the stock of homes available for sale remains relatively high although the level continues to decline. The global economy: Second-quarter growth data and monthly indicators point to some slowing in the rate of recoveryof the global economy, with an increase in the risk level. Global inflation remains moderate, and in some countries, the risk of deflation has increased due to the renewed decline in energy prices. Oil prices declined by about 18 percent this month, from $56 to $46 per barrel of Brent crude, against the background of supply factors (the agreement with Iran) and demand factors (the weakness in China's economy). The negative sentiment was also reflected in declines of stock market indices in Europe and in emerging markets, an increase in the emerging-market risk indices, and declines inyields in government bond markets. Market declines have become more severein many countries in the past few days. The US economy grew by 2.3 percentin the second quarter (in annual terms), with contraction in surplus exports against the background of the strong dollar. Manufacturing indicators were mostly disappointing, while real estate industry data were positive, andlabor market data were in line with expectations. There is still uncertainty regarding the timing of an increase in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve, and the probability reflected in capital markets of an initial increase occurring in September declined. GDP in Europe increased in the second quarter by 1.2 percent (in annual terms), a slightly lower rate thanthat of the first quarter. Germany's economy grew by 1.6 percent, a slightly lower rate than expected, growth in Italy and France surprised to the downside, while growth in Spain and in some European periphery countries surprised to the upside. Some of the weakness is a result of the crisisin Greece reaching a low in the second quarter, but some of it can also beattributed to long-term developments in China and in other emerging markets, which are a main export destination for Europe. In Greece, progress toward the formulation of an additional aid package continues, though disagreements remain on the matter. The summary of the ECB monetary discussion showsa readiness to adopt further policy measures should the need arise to support the recovery and inflation in the eurozone. Japan's economy contracted, as expected, at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, and should the slowdown continue, further accommodative measures will likely be adopted. Stock prices in China resumed their decline, and the government took a surprising step this month that enabled a relatively sharp depreciation of the yuan, following an effective appreciation of about 15 percent in the past year. Various economic activity indicators in China surprised to the downside, and additional monetary and fiscal policy measures withthe aim of supporting economic activity may be taken in the future. The developments in China negatively impacted other emerging markets, which were also affected by the declines in commodity prices and by continued capital outflows. Due to the depreciation of the yuan, the currencies of several countries for whom China is a significant trading partner also depreciated. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for September 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel'smonetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. Thepath of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, and the exchange rate of the shekel, as well as on monetary policies of major central banks. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The rate of increase in the CPI in recent months has been consistent with the inflation target. However, short-term inflation expectations declined sharply this month, against the background of decreases in energy and commodity prices in the past two months and the scheduled reduction in electricity prices; expectations are below the lower bound of the target range. Medium-term and long-term (forward) expectations remained entrenched near the midpoint of the inflation target range. C 2B 7 Indicators of real economic activity are volatile but point to some decline in the growth environment, relative to the 2.5-3.0 percent growth range of the past two years, with a decline in exports against the background of decreased world trade, and continued growth of current consumption. Labor market data indicates that the unemployment rate is low, and the job vacancy rate is relatively high, with employment growth primarily in the services industries. C 2B 7 Some slowdown is apparent in the global growth rate with an increase in the level of risk. Slowinggrowth in China is negatively impacting economic activity in numerous countries. In recent days there have been sharp declines in global financial markets, and the expected path of the US federal funds rate, as derived from capital markets, is lower than it was last month. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on July 26, 2015, through August 21, 2015, the shekel weakenedby 1.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, but it hasappreciated by 5.8 percent for the year to date. Even with the depreciation this month, the development of the exchange rate since the beginning of the year weighs on the growth of exports and of the tradable sector, and is delaying the return of the inflation rate to within the target range. C 2B 7 Robust activity in the housing market continued this month as well, and was reflected in an especially elevated level of new home sales, and in an acceleration in the rate of increase of home prices, which have increased by 4.4 percent in the past 12 months. Likewise, the pace of new mortgages taken out remains high. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to attaining the inflation target, and to growth, have increased. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli andglobal economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for September 2015 will be published on September 7, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. September 24, 2015. Print Page. The main considerations behind the decision.

Hungary,2015-08-25,"At its meeting on 25 August 2015, the Monetary Councilreviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintainthe central bank base rate 1.35%. Inthe Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue.While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains belowpotential and the domestic real economic environment is expected to continue tohave a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite thepick-up in domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve onlygradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. Withemployment rising, unemployment continues to exceed its long-term leveldetermined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remainmoderate. Consumerprices continued to show low dynamics in July, rising slightly compared withthe same period a year earlier. The incoming inflation data was consistent withthe projection in the June InflationReport. Annual core inflation was unchanged relative to previous months.The Bank's measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate moderateinflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting subdued imported inflation,falling commodity prices and the degree of unused capacity in the economy. Core inflation is likely torise gradually as domestic demand picks up; however, the continuing decline incommodity prices may moderate the increase in the consumer price index. Domesticreal economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationaryimpact. Consequently, inflation is expected to approachlevels around the 3 per cent target only towards the end of the forecast horizon,reflecting moderate underlying inflation. According to the preliminary estimate,domestic economic growth continued in the second quarter. Growth was slightlyslower than projected in the June InflationReport, presumably as a result of the weaker agricultural output. TheCouncil assesses that, based on the monthly macroeconomic indicators,underlying growth has not changed significantly and economic growth is likelyto continue at a rapid pace. In June, industrial production rose relative tothe previous month and the same period a year earlier. The dynamics of retailsales have been stable in recent months, with the volume of sales increasingacross a wide range of products. Rising household real income underpinned bylow inflation, the reduced need for deleveraging and growing employment areexpected to contribute to the increase in household consumption. Investment is expected to pickup gradually, owing to the recovery in activity, as well as the Funding forGrowth Scheme and its extension. Employment continued to grow, with the unemploymentrate falling below 7 per cent in the second quarter. Sentimentin global financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Council'slatest policy decision, but this has had little impact on domestic financialmarket indicators. Developments at the negotiations on the settlement of Greekgovernment debt led to an improvement in sentiment. By contrast, global risk appetite deteriorated,reflecting uncertainty about Chinese capital market developments and thecountry's growth outlook as well as an impending interest rate increase by theUS Fed. Domestic financial markets have been calm, with the forint fluctuatingagainst the euro within a narrow range. The domesticCDS spread and long-term government bond yields have been broadly unchangedsince the previous policy decision. The persistently high external financingcapacity of the Hungarian economy and the resulting decline in external debthave contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's assessment,a cautious approach to monetary policy is warranted due to uncertainty in theglobal financial environment. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy andinflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate. The negativeoutput gap is expected to close only gradually over the policy horizon. If theassumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, the current level of thebase rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period areconsistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and acorresponding degree of support to the economy."
India,2015-08-25,"Summary of the Electronic Consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy: July 2015 Consultation with external Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy was held electronically between July 22 and 28, 2015 in the run up to the Third Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review, 2015-16 on August 4, 2015. The main points suggested by Members are set out below. Members' assessment of the global economic activity was that though the overall level of activity was low, the US Fed sees policy risks shifting. Recent data point to moderate growth in the June quarter in the US following a weak growth in March quarter. While there have also been some increase in wage growth, core measures of inflation remained below the US Fed's inflation target. There are clear indications that initiation of normalisation of the policy stance would be sooner and gradual, rather than later and more rapid, suggesting a Fed fund rate hike in September or December. On Greece, while the prospects of a Greek exit from the Euro have diminished for now, it cannot be ruled out in the future. On the domestic front. Members noted that the real economy continues to be weak. With the IIP growth as subdued, the departure of the May slowdown (2.7 per cent) from the consensus estimates of 4 per cent is worrying. Comparatively speaking, the source of concern is on the consumer goods side, which continues to be weak with both consumer durable and consumer non-durable output contracting in May. The input sectors (mining and electricity) may continue to drive the expansion of the IIP, but whether these are a source of sustained growth will depend on how the policy framework evolves. The purchasing managers' index for both manufacturing and services has declined in June 2015 and new investment initiatives have not gathered steam, which is worrying. Exports dipping seven months in a row is also a major concern for growth, especially since a possible secular stagnation may constrain an export led revival. Regarding inflation, some Members were of the view that with the revival of monsoon in late July and reduction in rainfall deficit to 5 per cent, food prices may remain soft, keeping prospects of a sustained uptick in CPI inflation low. The current rise in food prices may be an aberration because of difficulties in transportation during heavy rains, although the rise in prices of pulses from 16 per cent in May to 22 per cent in June is significant. The Iran agreement will help keep oil prices soft. Food inflation is presently ruling well below 6 per cent. Core inflation, even after a steady climb since January 2015, is still ruling at 4.98 per cent. Other Members were not so comfortable with the increase in CPI2 inflation to 5.4 per cent in June from 5 per cent in May as this was an across the board increase. Food inflation increased to 5.7 per cent in June from 5.1 per cent in May. Protein items also saw strong sequential increases, although there may be some moderation forthcoming in certain items like pulses where higher imports have been allowed. High pulses inflation as well as of egg, meat and fish that may translate into inflation expectations may be kept in view while formulating the policy response. There was also an increase in core inflation driven in part by an increase in the service tax and higher petrol prices. Because a slowing down of rural wage growth should put downward pressure on various items of core inflation such as clothing and footwear, core inflation is likely to stay around the 5.5 per cent range this year, and may further dip in the near term because of lower petrol prices. Some increase in services inflation (miscellaneous category) however may arise because of the increase in service taxes effective June. Members found growing weakness on trade account as a serious medium-term risk to financial stability and economic performance. The fall in India's export growth is the largest among emerging markets and India is the fourth worst affected after Russia. Columbia and Peru. Therefore, fall in global demand may not be the only reason explaining the fall in exports. Since current account deficit is under control, oil prices have fallen further and commodity prices continue to be soft, some Members were of the view that downward adjustment of the nominal rupee exchange rate could encourage exports, without adding to inflation or upsetting foreign investors. Four of the seven Members recommended a reduction in the policy repo rate. Three of them suggested a reduction of 25 basis points. According to these Members, firstly, headline inflation target for January 2016 will be comfortably met. Secondly, domestic demand condition is weak and growth in bank credit, industrial production and exports are low. Thirdly, the fiscal situation is showing signs of improvement, with deficits coming down and the composition of government expenditure shifting towards capex. Fourthly, the US Fed may raise rates later this year. Therefore, the Members felt that the time is opportune to use the space that is available for a reduction in the policy repo rate. The fourth Member advocated a reduction in policy repo rate by 50 basis points as the real economy continues to be very weak, inflation risks are receding and both the fiscal and current account deficits are under control. Three Members recommended a status quo in the policy repo rate. According to them, firstly, with deceleration in credit growth, there is surplus liquidity in the markets as witnessed by the fact that the reverse repo operations are in excess of the repo operations and banks are holding significant excess investment in statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) securities. The rates for collateralised borrowing and lending obligations have generally been lower than the policy repo rate and banks are sourcing funds largely from this window. The excess liquidity should, therefore, result in further reduction in deposit rates and consequently the cost of funds would decline followed by reduction in lending rates. A reduction in repo rate at this stage may at best have a signaling effect but no real effect. Secondly, while both the inflation and IIP releases in July are unfavourable, progress of the monsoon over the July-August period will be crucial for the inflation outcome. Since this data will not be available for the August review, the Reserve Bank should “wait-and-see” as the data evolve, and this would suggest a pause. Thirdly, external conditions are such that the US economic activity is3 picking up, in the Euro area there are signs of growth improving in France and Germany, and even Japan is showing signs of a gradual recovery. Given the chance of the US Fed reversing its monetary policy stance early, it would be appropriate to keep the Indian stance on monetary policy unchanged. One of these members recommended that the Reserve Bank should continue the policy of open market operations to mop up excess liquidity even at the risk of further increase in yields. Another Member advocated a reduction in the SLR by 50 basis points. All the seven external Members  Shri Y.H. Malegam. Dr.Shankar Acharya. Dr.Arvind Virmani. Prof. Indira Rajaraman. Prof. Errol D'Souza. Prof. Ashima Goyal, and Prof. Chetan Ghate  sent their feedback through e-mail. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of discussions of the meetings of TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting.

Ukraine,2015-08-27,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has adopted a decision to reduce the discount rate from 30% to 27%, effective from August 28, 2015. The tight monetary policy pursued by the National Bank of Ukraine in the past six months helped firmly anchor inflation and devaluation expectations and contributed to the stabilization of the FX market, thus putting inflation firmly on a downward path. The annual Consumer Price Index has been on a downward path for the third month in a row, whereas in July Ukraine recorded deflation in month-on-month terms. The improvement of the situation in the FX market and stabilization of inflation expectations have encouraged the inflow of deposits to the banking system. The National Bank of Ukraine expects the disinflation trend to persist in the period ahead due to the maintenance of relative stability in the FX market, a fading wave of massive price increases in housing and utilities and a slow recovery of consumer demand. An additional factor behind the disinflation trend will be a high yield of grain, vegetables and fruit, which will contribute to the subdued food price dynamics. Given lower inflationary risks, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine deems it appropriate to embark on easing the monetary policy consistent with the projected decline in the annual inflation rate. However, despite the reduction in the discount rate from its current high level, the monetary policy will remain relatively tight to support the disinflation trend and shield the Ukrainian economy from external shocks currently experienced by global commodity and financial markets."
Poland,2015-09-02,"Warsaw, 2 September 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 1-2 September 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 1.75% on an annual basis. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate. In the euro area, economic recovery continues, despite slight weakening of GDP growth in 2015 Q2. In the United States, output growth has picked up. In turn, economic growth in China 2015 Q2 remained low as for this country and incoming data indicate that economic conditions might deteriorate further. Along with deepening recession in Russia and Brazil, this caused the increased concerns about the growth outlook of the developing countries. The rising risk of a stronger slowdown in emerging economies led to deterioration in the financial market sentiment and  in effect  to a drop of prices of many assets. In addition, prices of most commodities, including oil, have fallen again in the global markets. Amidst moderate global economic activity and low commodity prices, price growth in many countries remains very low. In the United States and the euro area, inflation is still close to zero, while in some European economies prices continue to decline. Major central banks keep interest rates at close to zero, but the Federal Reserve is signalling a possibility of their increase this year. At the same time, the ECB continues its asset purchase programme. The People's Bank of China has devalued the yuan, what was conducive to weakening of some emerging markets' currencies. In Poland. GDP growth in 2015 Q2 was slightly weaker than in the previous quarter. Economic growth continued to be driven primarily by consumption, supported by favourable labour market situation and growing household lending. GDP growth was also driven by further growth in investment  although weaker than in 2015 Q1  fuelled by good financial condition of enterprises. In turn, contribution of net exports to GDP growth declined markedly. July data on production and retail sales point to a stabilisation of economic growth in the following quarters. Due to moderate growth in demand and the continuing negative output gap, there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Moreover, low commodity prices and moderate nominal wage growth limit the risk of rising cost pressure. As a result, the annual 1/2 consumer price growth remains negative, although the scale of the deflation is gradually diminishing. Producer price growth is also negative and inflation expectations are running low. In the opinion of the Council, price growth will continue to slowly increase in the nearest quarters. Its growth will be supported by the expected stable economic growth, amidst the recovery in the euro area and a favourable situation in the domestic labour market. At the same time, increasing risk of stronger economic slowdown in emerging economies and the declining commodity prices have raised the uncertainty about the pace of inflation returning to the target. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged."
Euroarea,2015-09-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analysis, and in line with our forward guidance, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, following the announced review of the public sector purchase programme's issue share limit after the first six months of purchases, the Governing Council decided to increase the issue share limit from the initial limit of 25% to 33%, subject to a case-by-case verification that this would not create a situation whereby the Eurosystem would have blocking minority power, in which case the issue share limit would remain at 25%. Underlying our monetary policy assessment was a review of recent data, new staff macroeconomic projections and an interim evaluation of recent market fluctuations. The information available indicates a continued though somewhat weaker economic recovery and a slower increase in inflation rates compared with earlier expectations. More recently, renewed downside risks have emerged to the outlook for growth and inflation. However, owing to sharp fluctuations in financial and commodity markets, the Governing Council judged it premature to conclude on whether these developments could have a lasting impact on the outlook for prices and on the achievement of a sustainable path of inflation towards our medium-term aim, or whether they should be considered to be mainly transitory. Accordingly, the Governing Council will closely monitor all relevant incoming information. It emphasises its willingness and ability to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate and, in particular, recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the programme. In the meantime, we will fully implement our monthly asset purchases of €60 billion. These purchases have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. They are intended to run until the end of September 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment of the available information in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2015, which was somewhat lower than previously expected. The latest survey indicators point to a broadly similar pace of real GDP growth in the second half of this year. Overall, we expect the economic recovery to continue, albeit at a somewhat weaker pace than earlier expected, reflecting in particular the slowdown in emerging market economies, which is weighing on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, the decline in oil prices should provide support for households' real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. However, economic growth in the euro area is likely to continue to be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.4% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. Compared with the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down, primarily due to lower external demand owing to weaker growth in emerging markets. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside, reflecting in particular the heightened uncertainties related to the external environment. Notably, current developments in emerging market economies have the potential to further affect global growth adversely via trade and confidence effects. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.2% in August 2015, unchanged from June and July. Compared with the previous month, this reflects a further decline in energy price inflation, compensated for by higher price increases for food and industrial goods. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation rates will remain very low in the near term. Annual HICP inflation is expected to rise towards the end of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. Inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further during 2016 and 2017, supported by the expected economic recovery, the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate and the assumption of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead as currently reflected in oil futures markets. However, this increase in annual inflation rates is currently expected to materialise somewhat more slowly than anticipated thus far. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.1% in 2015, 1.1% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. In comparison with the June 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down, largely owing to lower oil prices. Taking into account the most recent developments in oil prices and recent exchange rates, there are downside risks to the September staff inflation projections. In this context, the Governing Council will closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. We will focus in particular on the pass-through of our monetary policy measures, as well as on global economic, financial, commodity price and exchange rate developments. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm robust growth in broad money (M3). The annual growth rate of M3 was 5.3% in July 2015, compared with 4.9% in June. Annual growth in M3 continues to be increasingly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 12.1% in July, compared with 11.7% in June. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.9% in July, up from 0.2% in June, continuing its gradual recovery since the beginning of 2014. Despite these improvements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial corporations remain subdued. They continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.9% in July 2015, after 1.7% in June. Overall, the monetary policy measures we have put in place since June 2014 provide clear support for improvements both in borrowing conditions for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates the need to firmly implement the Governing Council's monetary policy decisions and to monitor closely all relevant incoming information as concerns their impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. Further product and labour market reforms, and particularly actions to improve the business environment, including an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. The swift and effective implementation of these reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the benefits of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery while remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Full and consistent implementation of the Pact is crucial for confidence in our fiscal framework."
South Korea,2015-09-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well. Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility, due to the instabilities in the Chinese financial and foreign exchange markets and to a shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, although the recovery in domestic demand activities such as consumption and investment has continued, the trend of declining exports has persisted while the improvement in economic agents' sentiments has been inadequate. On the employment front, as the trend of increase in the number of persons employed slowed in August, owing mainly to a base effect, the employment-to-population ratio decreased while the unemployment rate rose compared to those in August of last year. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of recovery going forward, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to have increased. Despite declines in petroleum product prices, consumer price inflation registered 0.7% in August, the same as in July, in line mainly with expansions in the extents of increase in prices of other industrial products. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose slightly to 2.1%, from 2.0% in July. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen, as securities investment funds of foreigners have flowed out due to factors such as the instabilities in the Chinese financial and foreign exchange markets. Long-term market interest rates have fallen, influenced mainly by investor preference for safe assets. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as any shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the financial instabilities in emerging market countries including China, as well as the trends of capital flows."
Malaysia,2015-09-11,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Although growth across the advanced economies has improved, it has remained modest. In most of Asia, while there has been a moderation in growth, domestic demand continues to support economic activity. Looking ahead, while the global economic recovery is expected to continue, the downside risks to growth have increased arising from the moderating growth momentum in the major emerging market economies, uncertainty in commodity prices and the heightened volatility in financial markets. For Malaysia, recent indicators suggest continued expansion in economic activity in the third quarter despite ongoing adjustments to external and domestic developments. Private consumption is expected to moderate as households continue to adjust to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the more uncertain economic environment. Household spending will however be supported by wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be led by capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors, and ongoing infrastructure projects. The continued expansion in domestic demand is expected to contribute towards mitigating the weak performance of the external sector. Going forward, downside risks to growth, however, have risen amid greater uncertainty on both the global and domestic fronts. Of significance. Malaysia is entering this challenging period from a position of strength given the diversified sources of growth of the economy, low unemployment level, manageable level of external indebtedness, and a well-capitalised banking system. The assessment is therefore for the economic growth to remain within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent. Headline inflation averaged at 2.9% in June and July reflecting higher domestic fuel prices and the impact of the GST. Despite the weaker ringgit exchange rate, the impact on overall inflation has been limited by the lower commodity prices and the generally low global inflation. Moving forward, headline inflation is expected to peak in early 2016 and it will moderate for the remainder of the year. While global and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets, overall domestic liquidity conditions remain stable. The financial system remains sound, with healthy growth in financing. Financial intermediation has therefore continued to support the economy. The ringgit exchange rate is being affected by global factors that are affecting many emerging and commodity producing economies. These factors include the weaker commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the uncertainty in the global financial markets. The ringgit exchange rate will reflect the underlying fundamentals of the economy when the external and domestic uncertainties recede. Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to ensure the orderly functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are heightened risks in the global economic and financial environment. These risks are being carefully monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. Bank Negara Malaysia 11 September 2015."
Russia,2015-09-11,"On 11 September 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the key rate at 11.0 percent per annum, due to the higher inflation risks amid persistent risks of considerable economy cooling. August saw a serious deterioration in foreign economic conditions. Inflation and inflation expectations were showing a clear upward trend, impacted by the exchange rate dynamics. The depreciated ruble will continue to put pressure on prices in the next few months. However, the relatively tough monetary conditions and slack domestic demand will drag down annual inflation. The annual consumer price growth rate in September 2016 is estimated to be about 7%, reaching 4% in 2017, which will be facilitated by the current monetary policy. The Bank of Russia will subsequently revise its key rate based on the balance between inflation risks and the risks of economy cooling. Annual inflation rose from 15.6% in July to 15.8% in August. As of 7 September 2015, consumer price growth remained unchanged, according to the Bank of Russia's estimates. The ruble's depreciation caused prices for a wide range of goods and services to accelerate, which was the reason for elevated inflation expectations, along with the July indexation of utility tariffs. The ruble's decline observed in July-August will continue to put pressure on inflation in the next few months. The moderately tough monetary policy and weaker consumer demand on the back of significant contraction in real income are projected to hamper consumer price growth. The relatively tough monetary conditions also contain prices. Money supply (М2) growth rates remain low. Lending and deposit rates show a downward trend under the influence of the Bank of Russia's previous decisions to cut its key rate. On the one hand, this serves to keep ruble savings attractive; on the other hand, such rates sustain a high debt burden and tight creditworthiness requirements, leading to low annual bank credit growth rates. According to Rosstat estimates. GDP in Q2 2015 dropped by 4.6%. July saw some signs of stabilisation in production and consumption decline. Yet, the energy price slump, highly volatile global financial markets, and a grim outlook for economic growth in emerging economies exacerbate the risks of economic cooling in Russia. While structural factors are still curbing economic growth, current drop in production is of a cyclical nature. This is evidenced by low consumer and business confidence, as well as reduced utilisation of production capacities. However, the negative demographic trends keep unemployment low, while the labour market is adjusting to the new conditions largely through wage cuts and wider part-time employment. These factors, along with low level of retail lending, will result in further contraction of consumer spending. Fixed capital investment is predicted to continue on their downward path, driven by negative business expectations with regard to Russia's economic outlook and tight lending terms. Limited potential substitution of external finance with domestic one will be among the factors which, following the narrow nature of the Russian financial market and its high debt load, are likely to constrain investment demand. Still, investment is due to receive some support from the governmental anti-crisis programme. Weak investment and consumer activity will cause low demand for imports. Export volumes are expected to grow slightly, against the background of the floating exchange rate. As a result, net exports will be the only positive contributor to the annual output growth. Taking into account Q1 GDP data and the negative changes in external conditions, output is forecast to contract by 3.9-4.4% in 2015. Going forward, the economic situation will depend on the global energy prices and the economy's ability to adjust to external shocks. As a baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia considers that the oil price will linger at about $50 for the next three years. In these conditions, a decline in quarterly GDP growth is expected to be more protracted than previously forecast. Weak domestic demand and the relatively tough monetary conditions will trigger annual inflation reduction in 2015-2017. A slowdown in the annual consumer price growth will create prerequisites for further decrease in inflation expectations. In early 2016, annual inflation is expected to slow considerably due to, among other factors, its high base of 2015. The Bank of Russia forecasts the annual consumer price growth to be about 7% in September 2016 and to reach the 4% target in 2017, facilitated by the ongoing monetary policy. Key sources of inflation risks include a further worsening of external climate, persistently high inflation expectations and the revised planned 2016-2017 rate and price growth in the regulated sector, while social payments will be indexed and the overall budget policy will be eased. Moving forward, the Bank of Russia will make decisions on its key rate based on the changing balance of inflation risks and the risks of economy cooling. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors to review its key rate is scheduled for 30 October 2015. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Pakistan,2015-09-12,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Decision September 12, 2015 Year-on-year headline CPI inflation decelerated to. percent in August 2015 from. percent in August 2014. Following its declining trend of the past several months, the 12-month moving average CPI inflation came down to. percent in August 2015 from. percent in August 2014. Other indicators, such as core inflation measures, have also decreased in August 2015. Major sources of declining inflation are favorable supply shocks and demand management policies. The current deceleration owes much to the smooth supply of the perishable food items and falling international oil price pass-through to consumer prices. Continuation of current trends along with moderate pick up in aggregate demand would largely determine the path of inflation in FY16. Recent increases in natural and compressed natural gas prices and their likely second round impacts would be offset by lower global oil price that has yet to find the bottom. Thus there is no change in SBP's forecast of average CPI inflation for FY16 with its range of.5-5. percent remaining below the annual plan target of percent. There are, however, two possible upside risks to this forecast. Government plans of paring down of subsidy on electricity along with increase in its tariffs and the possible adverse impact of low food prices on crop production. Downside risks to the forecast include the lesser likelihood of recovery in global commodity prices including that of oil. With current trends and projections, the probability of downside risks appear to be greater than the upside risks. Moreover the latest IBA-SBP survey of September 2015 has reported lower inflation expectations for the coming months. The situation in external current account at the beginning of FY16 is not much different from the end of the last fiscal year. While the exports again declined in the month of July 2015, external current account deficit recorded slight improvement due to declining oil import payments and increasing workers' remittances. With favorable trends in these variables, current account deficit of the size of end-FY15 seems manageable in this fiscal year. This is supported by the expected surplus in the capital and financial account in FY16 on the back of planned Euro/Sukuk bonds inflows, official disbursements, and the remaining IMF funding under the EFF program. Apart from yielding an overall balance of payments surplus, this would help maintain the foreign exchange reserves' upward trajectory of the last two fiscal years. However increases in exports and foreign direct investments are imperative for sustainability of external sector. In this regard, recent improvements in law and order situation and continued macroeconomic stability are likely to increase the prospects for long-term foreign capital Page STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN inflows. Moreover going forward, much needed boost to Pakistani exports may come through US economic recovery and through further gains in EU's GSP-Plus scheme. However structural bottlenecks especially in the textile sector and subdued international commodity prices remain the major risk to exports outlook. The contraction in broad money (M2) during 1st July to 28th August, 2015 was mainly result of reduction in net domestic assets of the banking system. Increase in government borrowing from scheduled banks was offset by repayment to SBP and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) maturing during this period. The retirement of working capital in July FY16 by majority of the private sector businesses is as per their normal credit cycle. The off-take of fixed investment loans by energy generation and distribution, chemicals and services sectors signal possible pick- up in their productive activity in the coming months. Therefore in the coming days, credit off take is expected to strengthen further. Moreover monetary conditions, despite easing, still appear to be tight as real lending rates are hovering around percent since December FY15 due to rapidly falling inflation. Overall liquidity situation in financial markets remained stressed in the post July 2015 monetary policy period. Government borrowing from commercial banks. Eid related cash withdrawals, and some deposit withdrawal from banks due to seasonal factors increased liquidity shortfall in the money market. Considering liquidity shortages. SBP continued to support the market, keeping the overnight money market rate range bound. With better law and order situation, investor and consumer confidence is improving. After recording growth of. percent. Large-scale Manufacturing is expected to gain further traction at the back of improvement in energy supplies. Implementation of infrastructure development and energy projects under China Pakistan Economic Corridor would further enhance the improving investment environment. Therefore there is anticipation of higher economic activity in FY16 which is expected to boost credit uptake. Given the above macroeconomic conditions, the central board of Directors of SBP has decided to reduce the SBP policy rate by 50bps from. percent to. percent. Page."
Chile,2015-09-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 September 2015 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, financial markets remain highly volatile. Risks relating to developments in the Chinese economy stand out, as do the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming decision of the Federal Reserve and the worsened scenario for Latin America, particularly Brazil. Volatility has been also perceived in the prices of commodities, especially oil and, by a smaller magnitude, copper. Domestically, in August the CPI variation was unexpectedly high, owing largely to its more volatile components. This drove annual inflation to 5%. Core inflation—CPIEFE— brought no surprises with respect to the forecast. Inflation expectations rose at some terms, and their evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. Meanwhile, output and demand remain weak, and confidence indicators have become more pessimistic. Private job creation and annual wage growth show no major change from the previous month. In line with September's Monetary Policy Report, the Board considers that the convergence of inflation to 3% over the policy horizon will call for a reduction in the high monetary stimulus currently in place. Considering incoming data, it is foreseen that this process will begin shortly. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, in accordance with the inflation target. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2015-09-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2015 BCRP RAISED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy interest rate to 3.50 percent. The new level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the target range in the 2015-2016 forecast horizon and takes into account that: inflation expectations have increased, reaching levels similar to the upper rate of the inflation target range; inflation has been affected by temporary events, such as the rise of the prices of some food products and the depreciation of the nuevo sol against the dollar, the effect of these factors not being foreseen to extend in a general manner to the rest of prices; international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as high volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets, and economic activity has been recovering gradually. The new level of the policy rate is compatible with a real interest rate of 0.5 percent and reflects an expansionary monetary policy stance. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and stands ready, should it be necessary, to make adjustments in its monetary policy rate to lead inflation to the target range. The Board points out that the Central Bank has not started a sequence of hikes in its policy interest rate. Inflation in August showed a rate of 0.38 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.56 percent in July to 4.04 percent in August. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of perishable food products and electricity rates. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.09 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.36 percent in July to 3.48 percent in August, which reflects the effect of the changes recorded in the exchange rate. Inflation is expected to show a rate of 3.4 percent at end-2015 and a rate of 3.0 percent at end-2016. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations continue showing an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels, but with a faster pace of growth in the second half of the year. It is estimated that the economy would be growing at rates similar to those of the potential output in 2016. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to raise the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.25 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on October 15, 2015."
Egypt,2015-09-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 17, 2015 In its meeting held on September 17, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 925 percen. Headline CPI increased by 063 percent (m/m) in August compared to an increase of 071 in July, while the annual rate decelerated to 788 percent in August from 838 percent in July, supported by a favorable base effec. During the month, the sharp decline in the prices of poultry largely offset the increase in the prices of vegetables, while paid services and restaurant services increased reflecting indirect and second round effects from previously implemented fiscal reform measure. In the meantime, core CPI declined by 023 percent in August compared to an increase of 030 in July, leading the annual rate to drop to 561 percent in August from 649 percent in Jul. Looking ahead, upside risks to the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of broad- based declines in international commodity price. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 30 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q3 to record 46 percent (y/y) during the first nine months of the fiscal yea. This comes after real GDP growth recorded 22 percent (y/y) during 2013/1. The main contributors to growth during 2014/15 Q3 were the internal trade, construction, building and the real estate sectors, while the extractions sector remained wea. In the meantime, strong investment growth more than compensated for the negative contribution of the widening trade defici. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks and uncertainty that surround the global economy on the back of softening growth in emerging markets and challenges facing the Euro Area could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

United States,2015-09-17,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing moderately, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. On balance, labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term. Nonetheless, the Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Dennis P Lockhart; Jerome H Powell; Daniel K Tarullo; and John C Williams. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting."
Nigeria,2015-09-21,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique' No. 103 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. September 21 and 22, 2015 The Monetary Policy Committee met on 21st and 22nd September, 2015 against the backdrop of lingering uneven recovery in the global economy and slowing domestic growth. In attendance were 10 out of 12 members. The Committee reviewed developments in global and domestic economic and financial environments in the first eight months of 2015 in order to provide the policy direction for the rest of fiscal 2015. International Economic Developments The Committee observed a divergence in the global economic environment, with a gradual but steady growth in the United States and UK but a slowdown in emerging and developing economies. The underlying drivers of growth in the advanced economies included improving financial conditions and consumer sentiments, suppressed commodity prices and favorable labour market 1 conditions. On the flip side, the slowdown in the emerging and developing economies is mainly attributable to tight external financial conditions, mostly a direct consequence of reduced revenues from weak commodity prices, fragile global demand and other geo-political factors. Aided by strong consumer spending, continuous improvement in the housing and labour markets and wage growth, the United States continues to benefit from soft energy and other commodity prices evidenced by the country's revised second quarter 2015 GDP growth of 37 per cent. Growth outlook in the second half, however, remains moderate as exports could slow on the heels of a strengthening dollar and slowing growth in China. The Bank of Japan maintained accommodative monetary policy through its asset purchasing program, with monthly injection of ¥67 trillion (US$5548 billion), resulting in stronger than anticipated second quarter growth. Following its September 3, 2015 meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) retained its key policy rate, even as its asset purchasing program continued, while inflation remained largely subdued. In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England also continued its asset purchase program as the economy maintained a robust growth path in the second quarter, with a modest uptick in inflation. These 2 developments have started to trigger the debate over when the Bank of England (BoE) would start raising its rates. Mindful of the potential impact of a rate adjustment, particularly on the emerging markets and considering the sluggish recovery in the Euro Area and Japan as well as the need to firm up recent growth and employment gains in the domestic economy, the US Federal Reserve voted at its September meeting to maintain its key interest rate, and delay monetary policy normalization. The decision is expected to strengthen stability in global economy and moderate volatility in the financial markets, while also consolidating recovery at home. In the emerging markets and developing economies, expectations of low growth continued into the third quarter of 2015, with strong likelihood of moderate uptick in 2016. Output growth in China at 70 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, is expected to moderate further, due to slower productivity and exports, collapsing assets value and excess capacity in the manufacturing sector. Global inflation is expected to remain tepid as the recent temporary rebound in oil prices and stronger consumer sentiments have mildly raised consumer prices in the advanced economies. Consumer price developments were mixed in emerging and developing economies. Commodity importing economies have continued to benefit from low global oil and other commodity prices, while others, 3 especially exporters of primary commodities, are contending with increased pressure on their currencies and fiscal position; and in some cases, significant inflation pass-through to domestic prices. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output Output growth in the first half of 2015 trended downwards from the level in the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly on account of softening oil prices. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), real GDP grew by 235 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, a significant decrease when compared with the 396 and 654 per cent in the preceding quarter and corresponding period of 2014, respectively. Real GDP growth is projected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to stabilize at 263 per cent in 2015, compared with the 622 per cent recorded in 2014. The non-oil sector remained the main driver of growth in the second quarter of 2015, at 346 per cent. The key drivers were services, trade and agriculture, contributing 180, 095 and 082 percentage points, respectively. On the other hand. Oil and Natural Gas sector declined by 073 percentage point an improvement of 113 percentage points relative to the first quarter of 2015. The overall outlook for economic activity is expected to improve on account of sustained improvement in the supply of power and refined petroleum products and progress with counter-insurgency in the North East axis. The Committee reiterated its commitment to efforts in support of the various ongoing Federal Government initiatives to stimulate output growth. Prices The Committee noted that the year-on-year headline inflation edged upwards to 93 per cent in August, from 92 per cent in June and July, 2015. The increase in headline inflation in August reflected marginal increases in both the core and food components of inflation. Core inflation rose to 90 per cent in August from 88 per cent in July, while food inflation increased to 101 per cent from 1005 per cent over the same period. The Committee observed that the uptick in inflation was mainly traceable to higher energy prices, delayed harvests and pass through from imports. It however, noted with satisfaction, the continued moderation in all measures of month-on-month inflation across all the measures. In August, on a month-on-month basis, headline inflation rose by 059 per cent from 069% in July; core inflation rose by 061 per cent, same as in July. Month-on-month food inflation also moderated to 063 per cent in August, from 077 per cent in July. The Committee, while reiterating its commitment to price stability, noted that the rising inflationary trend was a concern given the already tight monetary policy stance of the Bank. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments 6 Broad money supply (M2) contracted by 223 per cent in August 2015, below the level at end-December 2014. When annualized. M2 contracted by 334 per cent, which was significantly below the growth benchmark of 1524 per cent for 2015. Net domestic credit (NDC) rose by 1100 per cent, which annualizes to 1649 per cent in the same period. At that level. NDC was within the provisional benchmark of 2930 per cent for 2015. The growth in aggregate credit was attributable mainly to growth in Federal Government borrowing which reached 14013 per cent in August 2015 or 21019 per cent when annualized. During the period under review, rates in all segments of the money market were largely influenced by the level of liquidity in the banking system. Money market interest rates were relatively volatile, reflecting fluctuations in banking system liquidity during the period. Average inter-bank call and OBB rates, which opened at 1085 and 1065 per cent in June, 2015, closed at 3107 and 2810 per cent, respectively, in August, 2015. Average inter-bank call and OBB rates for the period were 1495 and 1717 per cent, respectively. The Committee noted the bearish trend in the equities segment of the capital market during the review period. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) fell by 88 per cent from N1142 trillion to N1042 trillion during the same period. However relative to end-December 2014, the 7 indices decreased by 125 and 93 per cent, respectively. The decline in share prices (year-to-date) was largely due to subdued sentiments preceding the general elections, which held in March and concerns for the country's foreign reserves position due to declining global oil prices. External Sector Developments The average naira exchange rate remained relatively stable at the inter-bank segment, but significantly volatile in the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market during the review period. The interbank exchange rate opened at N19695/US$ and closed at N19700, at a daily average of N19698/US$ between June 29 and September 18, 2015 representing a depreciation of N05K for the period. At the bureau-de-change segment, the exchange rate opened at N22450/US$ and closed at N21150. This represented an appreciation of N1300k for the period. The relative stability in the inter-bank market and improvement in the BDC segment were attributed to the effects of various administrative and policy measures. Consequently gross official reserves decreased modestly from US$3120 billion at end-July 2015 to $3063 billion on September 17, 2015. Committee's Considerations 8 The Committee noted that the overall macroeconomic environment remained fragile. The economy further slowed in the second quarter of the year, making it the second consecutive quarterly less-than- expected performance. The Committee noted that growth had come under severe strains arising from declining private and public expenditures. In particular, it noted the impact of non-payment of salaries at the state and local government levels as a key dampening factor on consumer demand. Year-on-year headline inflation continued to trend upwards, although the month-on-month measure moderated. Demand pressure in the foreign exchange market remained significant as oil prices continued to decline. Arising from these developments, there were indications that some of the banking sector performance indicators could be stressed if conditions worsen further. Specifically the Committee noted that liquidity withdrawals following the implementation of the TSA, elongation of the tenure of state government loans as well as loans to the oil and gas sectors could aggravate liquidity conditions in banks and impair their financial intermediation role, thus affecting economic growth, unless some actions were immediately taken to ease liquidity conditions in the markets. Having seen two consecutive quarters of slow growth, the Committee recognized that the economy could slip into recession in 2016 if proactive steps were not taken to revive growth in key sectors of the economy. In the face of prevailing circumstances, the Committee acknowledged that synergy between monetary and fiscal policies remained the most potent option to sustainable growth. The Committee further observed that the impact of the persistent decline in global crude oil prices on the fiscal position of Government continues to reflect in rising credit to government. The Committee also noted that the initial market reaction to the decision by JP Morgan to exclude the country from its Government Bond Index for Emerging Economies (GBI-EM) had largely dissipated as yields soon adjusted to their pre-announcement levels' adding that there may be second round effects over the next two months as the economy adjusts to that decision. The Committee reiterated its unwavering commitment to naira exchange rate stability despite the pressures. Mindful of the possibility of diversion of any extra liquidity to the foreign exchange market, the Committee urged the Bank to closely monitor the nature and sources of demand pressure in the foreign exchange market to ensure that funds were not diverted to demand for foreign exchange but applied to specific growth- enhancing asset creation lending by banks. It further noted that sectors such as agriculture and MSMEs were sectors for rapid generation of productive employment and wealth creation, and must therefore, be painstakingly encouraged. On inflation, the Committee was optimistic that as harvests progress in the coming months, pressure on food prices would gradually 10 recede, while growth enhancing measures would over the medium term have some moderating effect on food prices. Overall the Committee expressed optimism that business confidence would continue to improve as the Government continues to unfold its economic plans. In addition, some of the reassuring measures of the administration including efforts aimed at resolving fiscal challenges at the sub-national levels, and the fight against corruption and improving the business environment would unlock the inflow of foreign direct investment. The Committee also underscored the imperative of growing and protecting the country's foreign reserves and building fiscal buffers in the process of strengthening confidence in the economy, which is essential for promoting growth and stability. The MPC also observed that despite the TSA, banking system liquidity ratio remained moderate. Consequently the Committee advised on the urgent imperative of banks to aggressively support the efforts of government at job creation by channeling available liquidity into target growth enhancing sectors of the economy such as agriculture and manufacturing. This is with a view to promoting employment creation through conscious efforts aimed at directing lending to the growth enhancing sectors of the economy. The Committee considered that the Bank and deposit money banks, must strive to reverse the slowing GDP trajectory by actively stepping up their efforts in 11 catalyzing the economy with substantial new loans to the target sectors earlier highlighted. The Committee's Decisions In consideration of the underlying fundamentals of the economy, particularly the declining output growth, rising unemployment, evolving international economic environment as well as the need to properly position the economy on a sustainable growth path, the MPC decided by a vote of 7 to reduce the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) from 31 per cent to 25 per cent while 3 voted to hold. By a unanimous vote, the MPC voted to retain the MPR at 13 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: Reduce the CRR from 31 to 25 per cent; Retain the MPR at 13 per cent; Retain the symmetric corridor of 200 basis points around the MPR; and Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.

Armenia,2015-09-22,"PRESS RELEASE 22.09.2015 At September 22, 2015 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, 10.25%. There was 0.1% of inflation in August of 2015 against 0.7% reported in the same reference month last year. The 12‐month inflation rate continued falling, at a slower pace than expected, to 3.6% at the end of the month. Trends of slow global economic growth persisted in the external sector while international commodity markets remained deflationary. This is why, the Board estimates, inflationary effects from the external sector in the coming months are not likely. However, in anticipation of capital outflows from developing countries because of expected rise of policy rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve System, volatilities in the world's financial and foreign exchange markets have substantially increased, generating inflationary risks. The Board notes that higher than expected growth rates of economic activity were maintained in the third quarter too, and this has been mainly due to supply‐side factors. Expansionary fiscal policy has contributed to the recovery of domestic demand to a certain extent and a partial offset of the deflationary environment. The above developments with aggregate supply and demand have speeded up net export growth rates, significantly improving Armenia's external balance. The Board believes that such developments with economic fundamentals have notably increased the country's resilience to external shocks. Growing volatility in financial and foreign exchange markets of the world has created relatively high domestic inflation expectations, which prevented the shaping of a lower inflationary environment. In this situation, the Board considers it appropriate to maintain current monetary conditions, in which case the 12‐month inflation rate will subdue and afloat within the lower bound of the confidence band by the end of the year. This kind of monetary policy will enable to reduce and anchor inflation expectations in the coming period and fulfill the inflation target over a medium‐term perspective. If needed, the Board will adjust the monetary policy directions in line with inflation expectations in the domestic economy and developments in external financial markets in order to achieve the goal of price stability over the medium term. Detailed information based on the setting of interest rate will be available in Press Release (Interest Rate Minutes) due on October 2, 2015. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… Press Service of the Central Bank."
Turkiye,2015-09-22," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remained weak in the first half of the year, while domestic demand contributed to growth moderately. The composition of growth is expected to shift gradually towards net exports in upcoming periods with the support of rising demand from the European Union economies. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the impact of the uncertainty in domestic and global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to maintain the tight liquidity stance as long as deemed necessary. Moreover, the Committee assessed the measures already implemented and to be implemented in the context of the “road map during the normalization of global monetary policies”. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the improvements in the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be monitored closely and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2015-09-23,"23.09.15 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 1.0 Percentage Points to 7.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 23, 2015 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 100 basis points to 7.0 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, which indicates a sharp increase in the inflation expectations given the Lari depreciation against the USD, which raises the future risks as a result of a one-time deviation from the inflation target. In line with the existing forecast the Monetary Policy Committee considers appropriate to increase the interest rate by 1.0 percentage point to 7.0 percent. The annual growth in consumer prices equaled 5.4% in August. According to the current forecast, after the temporary deviation from the target the inflation will return to the target level by the end of 2016. The main factors causing rise in inflation are still coming from the supply side, namely the increase in the intermediate costs due to exchange rate depreciation and higher prices on certain imported goods. An important impact on the inflation came from the one-time increase in the electricity tariff. The rise in inflation has been limited by the weak aggregate demand and decrease in the world prices of oil and food products. The real GDP growth in the second quarter was consistent with the forecasts. The factor hindering the growth is the external sector, which, given the dire economic situation in the region negatively affects the export of goods and services. The domestic demand is also weak, as a result of the decline in remittances and increase in the service burden of foreign currency denominated loans. There have been some positive developments in relation to the elimination of external imbalance. Given the decrease in foreign currency remittances the change in the exchange rate has caused import to adjust. In the five months since April the import has decreased by 20 percent (not taking into account the import of hepatitis C treatment medications, funded through the grant). Accordingly we can assume that the impact of the existing external shock on the exchange rate has been exhausted. Other things equal no additional pressure can be expected on the exchange rate coming from the existing external shock. The NBG will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to prevent the negative expectations that have been on the rise in the recent period from growing into inflationary process. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on November 4, 2015."
Philippines,2015-09-23,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of the dynamics and risks in the inflation environment over the policy horizon. While latest baseline forecasts show that inflation could fall below the inflation target range of 3 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2015 due to the successive low inflation outturns in recent months, inflation is projected to return gradually to a path consistent with the inflation target for 2016-2017. Meanwhile, inflation expectations also remain anchored within the inflation target band over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board noted that upside risks could come from the impact of stronger and protracted El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates as well as pending petitions for power rate adjustments. In addition, the Monetary Board considered the weakness in the global economy and the continuing uncertainty in the global financial markets. The Monetary Board likewise is of the view that domestic demand conditions remain firm, supported by buoyant business and consumer sentiment and ample domestic liquidity. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that the benign inflation outlook and the economy's underlying growth momentum provide ample room to keep monetary policy settings unchanged at this time. The BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance stays in line with maintaining price and financial stability."
South Africa,2015-09-23,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 23 September 2015 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, risks to the global economic outlook have increased against the backdrop of a slowing Chinese economy. These risks, in conjunction with continued capital outflows from emerging markets, have resulted in heightened global financial market volatility and contributed to the decision by the US Fed to maintain its current monetary policy stance. This delay has added uncertainty to an already volatile global setting. The domestic economic outlook has deteriorated following the surprise contraction in the second quarter of the year. At the same time, the rand experienced a further significant depreciation in response to domestic and global developments, intensifying the upside risks to the inflation outlook. The combination of sharply slowing growth and rising inflation compounds the dilemma facing monetary policy. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,0 per cent and 4,6 per cent in July and August respectively. 1 The decrease in the inflation in August was mainly the result of changes in the housing and utilities and transport indices. Having reached a recent high of 5,8 per cent in January and February, the Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5,3 per cent, down from 5,4 per cent in July. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased from 3,3 per cent in July to 3,4 per cent in August, down from 3,7 per cent in June. The upward trend is expected to continue in the coming months as the impact of higher agricultural crop and food prices becomes more apparent. The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed marginally, with a near term improvement and a slight medium term deterioration. Inflation is now expected to average 4,7 per cent in 2015, from 5,0 per cent previously, and then to breach the upper end of the target range in the first quarter of 2016, with a peak of 6,7 per cent (previously 6,9 per cent). Inflation is then expected to be around the top end of the target range with a further temporary breach of 6,2 per cent in the final quarter. This breach is mainly due to base effects from the lower starting point for the petrol price in the fourth quarter of this year. The forecast for 2017 follows a slow downward trend, with inflation measuring 5,7 per cent in the final quarter. The changes in this trajectory are mainly due to the more depreciated starting point for the real effective exchange rate, which is offset to some extent by a lower international oil price assumption. The forecast for core inflation is marginally higher in the later quarters, but with an unchanged expected average of 5,4 per cent in 2016, and slightly higher at 5,3 per cent in 2017, up from 5,2 per cent. 2 Inflation expectations as measured by the survey conducted in the third quarter by the Bureau for Economic Research are more or less unchanged and remain at the upper end of the target range. Average inflation expectations for 2016 are unchanged at 6,1 per cent, and reverted to 5,9 per cent for 2017, following the decline to 5,8 per cent in the previous quarter. As before, there were marked differences between the different categories of respondents, with the 2017 expectations averaging 5,4 per cent for financial analysts, 6,5 per cent for business people and 5,9 per cent for trade unionists. Average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 6,0 per cent to 5,9 per cent, but those of business people reverted back to their 2014 level of 6,5 per cent, from 6,3 per cent previously. Median annual inflation expectations of market analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey are almost identical to those of the Bank's forecast and more or less unchanged since the previous survey. The breakeven inflation rates derived from the inflation-linked bonds have increased moderately since the previous meeting, and have remained above the upper end of the target range across all maturities. The global economic outlook has become more uncertain since the previous meeting of the MPC driven in part by the strong financial market reactions to the deteriorating outlook for the Chinese economy. Although the growth prospects in the US remain positive, they have been clouded by the growing concerns about possible spillbacks from a slowdown in emerging markets, particularly in China, as well as from the impact of the strong dollar. Euro area growth moderated in the second quarter and remains relatively subdued, while real output in Japan declined. 3 Growing concerns of the risk of an abrupt slowdown in the Chinese economy have been fuelled by excess capacity in the real estate market and in the industrial sectors of the economy. The recent equity market correction, the surprise devaluation of the renminbi, and the uncertain policy responses have added to these concerns. While to date the actual slowdown has been relatively moderate, a hard landing could have a severe impact on global markets, and on commodity prices in particular. These developments have had an adverse effect on the outlook for commodity producers, particularly emerging market economies, but Asian economies with close trade links with China have also been affected. The deteriorating terms of trade have compounded the impact of continued capital flows from emerging markets in anticipation of US monetary policy normalisation. Consensus growth forecasts for most Latin American and Asian economies have accordingly been revised downwards. Lower commodity prices have contributed to a more benign global inflation environment, although some emerging markets are experiencing inflationary pressures through depreciating currencies. In the United States, concerns about the possible restraining effect of the appreciating dollar on domestic economic activity and inflation, coupled with global financial market volatility and the risks of a sharp slowdown in emerging markets were key factors in the decision to delay the commencement of monetary policy normalisation. The ECB has indicated that further monetary easing is being contemplated while developments in Japan suggest that monetary policies will remain highly accommodative for some time. Domestic financial markets, including bond and equity markets, have not been immune to the turmoil in global markets. Although the rand has been one of the more 4. Although the rand has been one of the more 4 volatile currencies, having fluctuated in a range of between around R12,60 and just over R14,00 against the US dollar since the previous MPC meeting, its trend depreciation over the year has not been significantly different to those of other commodity currencies and a number of other peer emerging economies. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by about 9 per cent against the US dollar, by about 10 per cent against the euro and by about 8 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand was negatively impacted by developments in China, continued speculation regarding the timing of US policy “take-off”, and the weaker-than-expected GDP growth outcome. The rand reacted positively to the US decision to maintain its policy stance, as well as to the narrowing deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. The rand exchange rate remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook. As noted in previous statements, a key uncertainty for the MPC is the extent to which the US policy normalisation is already priced into the currency. The fact that the rand appreciated in response to the Fed decision suggests that some depreciation is likely when US rates are increased. However, the extent is uncertain, with the possibility of a temporary overshoot in a highly volatile environment. A further uncertainty relates to the sustainability of the contraction in the current account of the balance of payments in the second quarter when a deficit of 3,1 per cent of GDP was recorded. While this narrowing is attributed in part to temporary factors, there appears to be some evidence that both export and import volumes are responding to the depreciation of the rand and the weaker economy. However, the Bank expects this process of adjustment to remain slow, with the export response 5. However, the Bank expects this process of adjustment to remain slow, with the export response 5 inhibited by a number of factors including headwinds from the slowing global economy, electricity supply constraints and declining tourism receipts. The domestic economic growth outlook deteriorated compared with the previous forecast. This follows the surprise annualised contraction of 1,3 per cent in the second quarter of this year. While the MPC is of the view that a further contraction is unlikely in the third quarter, the outlook remains relatively weak amid declining business and consumer confidence. The Bank's forecast for growth has been revised down by half a percentage point in each year of the forecast period, to 1,5 per cent in 2015, and to 1,6 per cent and 2,1 per cent in the subsequent two years. The Bank's estimate of potential output for 2015 has also been revised down to 1,8 per cent. The risks to the growth outlook are now seen to be more or less balanced. This weak outlook is consistent with the Bank's leading indicator of economic activity which has exhibited a more pronounced downward trend in recent months. The growth disappointment was particularly evident in the goods-producing sectors of the economy, with contractions in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, although growth in the services sectors also moderated. The agricultural sector remains constrained by the continuing drought, and although mining output increased in July, prospects are being negatively affected by weak commodity prices, lower global demand and the risk of industrial action in parts of the sector. Manufacturing output also increased marginally in July but the decline in the Barclays PMI to below the neutral 50 level in August, and a further decline in capacity utilisation suggest a challenging outlook. Growth in gross fixed capital formation moderated to 1,0 per cent in the second quarter, with general government providing the only notable increase. The weak 6 contribution from the private sector is reflected in the further sharp decline in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index to its lowest level since 2011. The only area where private sector investment increased markedly was with respect to energy- generation projects. This disappointing scenario does not bode well for employment growth, despite the decline in the official unemployment rate to 25,0 per cent in the second quarter, mainly due to growth in informal sector employment. Growth in consumption expenditure by households also reflects the subdued demand conditions in the economy, with a moderation in growth to 1,2 per cent in the second quarter, with some resilience only evident in semi-durable goods consumption. Retail sales grew only marginally in July, amid a sharp decline in the business confidence of retailers. The weakness in durable goods sales is evident in the lower new vehicles sales in August, particularly commercial vehicles. Consumers are expected to remain constrained against the backdrop of slow employment growth, declining disposable income growth, and rising inflation. Furthermore, the pace of credit extension to households, which remains negative in real terms, is expected to be impacted further by the tighter affordability criteria following the implementation of amendments to the National Credit Regulations. At the same time, household deleveraging has continued with the debt to disposable income ratio moderating further to 77,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, its lowest level since 2006. Credit extension to the corporate sector, by contrast has been buoyant, particularly with respect to general loans and mortgage advances. No new data concerning wage and unit labour cost developments have become available since the previous meeting of the MPC, but trends are expected to be 7. No new data concerning wage and unit labour cost developments have become available since the previous meeting of the MPC, but trends are expected to be 7 relatively unchanged, with average nominal wage growth in excess of inflation contributing to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Although food price developments have been relatively benign, they remain a concern to the MPC with the expectation of an acceleration in the coming months as the impact of the drought feeds through to consumer prices. This is despite the favourable impact of falling prices at the global level. Domestic food price inflation at the consumer level appears to have reached a low point of 4,3 per cent in June, increasing marginally to 4,4 per cent in July and August. The pressures are expected to come from the drought-induced increases in agricultural price inflation for cereals and crops which increased at a year-on-year rate of 38,7 per cent in July. The recent decline in international oil prices has provided some respite to inflation pressures, with the price of Brent crude oil currently trading at around US$10 per barrel lower than at the time of the previous MPC meeting. The current global oversupply of crude oil coupled with the slowdown in China is expected to keep oil prices contained in the short to medium term. The MPC revised down its oil price assumption by between US$3 and US$4 per barrel in each of the coming years. However, the Committee assesses the risk to the oil price assumption to be on the downside, particularly in the short term. The domestic petrol price declined by a cumulative R1,20 per litre in August and September, and current trends suggest that no significant change is likely in October, with the weaker rand offsetting the impact of the falling dollar price of oil. The inflation outlook remains a concern for the Monetary Policy Committee, with the risks to the forecast assessed to be on the upside. Although two breaches of the target are now expected - in the first and fourth quarters of next year - they are 8. Although two breaches of the target are now expected - in the first and fourth quarters of next year - they are 8 expected to be temporary and primarily the result of base effects from lower petrol prices four quarters previously. Nevertheless, the Monetary Policy Committee is concerned that the longer-term inflation trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range, and given the upside risks to inflation, the probability of a more extended breach than currently forecast is relatively high. A sustained breach of the target range has the danger that it could impact negatively on inflation expectations which are currently sticky at the upper end of the target range. The MPC is also concerned about domestic growth prospects, with the economy contracting in the second quarter. Growth is expected to remain constrained by global developments and associated uncertainty and volatility, low business and consumer confidence and electricity supply shortages. Domestic inflation is not driven by demand factors, and the outlook for household consumption expenditure has deteriorated. However, we have to be mindful of the second-round effects of supply-side shocks on inflation. There are a number of upside risks to the inflation outlook, the primary one being the exchange rate which has already depreciated significantly against the advanced economy currencies in response to global developments, and is still likely to react further to the commencement of US monetary policy tightening. A further risk emanates from possible higher multi-year increases in electricity tariffs from the middle of next year. Downside risks to the inflation outlook include international oil prices should they be sustained at current levels. In addition, weak domestic demand may continue to 9. In addition, weak domestic demand may continue to 9 constrain pricing power in the economy. The Committee nevertheless assesses the overall risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside. As noted in previous statements, the MPC has to achieve a fine balance between realising its core mandate and not undermining short term growth unduly. The MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now at 6,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains on a gradual policy normalisation path. The Committee will continue to monitor developments closely, and will not hesitate to act appropriately should the risks to the inflation outlook deteriorate materially. As before, any future moves remain highly data dependent. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 Candice."
Czech Republic,2015-09-24,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. Despite an expected increase, it will remain below the target for most of next year. According to the forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will not occur until early 2017. A need to maintain significantly expansionary monetary conditions therefore persists. The Bank Board assesses the risks to the current forecast over the next few quarters as being anti-inflationary. At the monetary policy horizon, these anti-inflationary risks are offset by better-than-forecasted data from the domestic economy. In this situation, the Bank Board stated again that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the second half of 2016. The exchange rate will therefore be at CZK 27 to the euro or weaker at least until mid-2016. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate at the forecast horizon to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to domestic prices and other nominal variables. Annual headline inflation has been falling so far in Q3. It stood at 0.3% in August, 0.4 percentage point below the forecast. This deviation was mainly due to food prices, which returned to a modest year-on-year decline in August. To a lesser extent, the lower inflation was due to a larger-than-forecasted decrease in fuel prices stemming from a further drop in oil prices. The other inflation components were in line with the forecast. As expected, administered prices switched to a moderate decline at the start of Q3. Despite still very subdued inflation abroad, adjusted inflation remained stable just above 1%, reflecting continued buoyant growth of the domestic economy and marked improvements in the labour market. The growth of the Czech economy accelerated to 4.4% in Q2, whereas the forecast had expected it to slow compared to the previous quarter. The one percentage point deviation of GDP growth from the forecast was due almost exclusively to higher additions to inventories. Economic growth remains balanced, with all the expenditure components contributing in year-on-year terms. The dynamic growth in economic activity is also evidenced by a further slight pick-up in gross value added growth. Its increase is being driven mainly by industry, but to an increased extent also by services and other sectors linked to domestic demand. New information on developments abroad obtained from the September Consensus Forecasts suggests that demand in the effective euro area will continue to rise at a steady pace. By contrast, the forecast for euro area producer prices has been revised slightly downwards for the rest of this year and the first half of next year. Growth in producer prices is still not expected to resume until next year as the effect of the fall in oil prices unwinds. Owing to lower energy prices for households, the outlook for consumer price inflation in the effective euro area has also shifted slightly downwards for this year and the next. However, consumer price inflation is still expected to rise gradually towards 2%. The market outlook for the 3M Euribor remains unchanged at zero for this year and the next. The expected slight increase in interest rates in 2017 has been reduced further. This reflects recent ECB communication confirming its readiness to extend and increase its quantitative easing programme. The market outlook for Brent crude oil prices has decreased markedly over the entire forecast horizon. Moreover, the new outlook has reduced the expected weakening of the euro against the dollar, which in turn lowers expected euro and koruna prices of oil. The accelerating domestic economic growth is fostering a further improvement in the labour market situation. Total employment growth accelerated further in 2015 Q2. Growth in labour demand is also documented by a steadily rising number of vacancies, which exceeded 100,000, almost double the level of a year earlier. The general unemployment rate fell further in Q2 and the decline in the share of unemployed persons has also continued in Q3 so far. At the end of August, labour offices registered 450,000 job applicants, 85,000 fewer than in the same period of last year. Driven by both the business and non-business sectors, annual wage growth picked up pace much more strongly than expected by the CNB forecast. The July data on industry also indicate continuing wage growth. Indicators from the real economy point to continued robust economic growth in 2015 Q3. Annual industrial production growth has been accelerating since April and slightly exceeded 7% in July. The growth rate of construction output reached double figures. Retail sales are also still rising apace in both the automotive and non-automotive segments. The price decrease in manufacturing, which started in November 2014 in connection with the drop in oil prices and a continuing decline in euro area producer prices, still persists and has gradually been gaining pace since June this year. By contrast, the year-on-year decline in agricultural producer prices has been slowing in recent months. The price increase in market services has almost halted since February, with market prices even edging down year on year in July and August. On the other hand, construction work prices are still rising moderately. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, annual GDP growth was considerably above the forecast in 2015 Q2, whereas inflation was lower than forecasted in August. The average wage increased faster than expected in Q2, owing to developments in both the business and non-business sectors. Unemployment has been falling broadly in line with the forecast."
Israel,2015-09-24,"Remarks by the Governor of the Bank of Israel. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor August declined by 0.2 percent, below the average of forecasters' projections, which was for it to remain unchanged. There were seasonal declines in the fruit and vegetables component (1.5 percent), and in the clothing and footwear component (3.7 percent). There was also a marked decline in the transport and communication component (1.3 percent). The housing component increased by 0.7 percent, and there was a seasonal increase in education, culture and entertainment (1 percent). The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.4 percent, compared with an inflation rate of negative 0.3 percent over the 12 months that ended in July. CPI components representing tradable goods declined by 1.6 percent over the past 12 months, and CPI components representing nontradable items increased by 0.4 percent. The CPI excluding energy, food,and fruit and vegetables increased by 0.8 percent. The rate of increase in the CPI in the past few months is consistent with achieving the lower bound of the inflation target, but several one-off factors are expected to act in the coming months to reduce the CPI: the decline in electricity prices, the cancellation of the television fee, and the effect of the VAT reductionare expected to reduce the CPI by 0.7 percent in the next three months. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The planned price reductions noted above led to a further decline this monthin short-term inflation expectations from the various sources. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined from 0.7 percent to 0.4 percent, and expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates declined from 0.35 percent to 0.2 percent. Twelve-monthahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market also declined, from 0.6 percent to 0.4 percent, and expectations for 2 years declined from 0.9 percent last month to 0.8 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) forward expectations remained around 1.4 percent this month, while forward expectations for longer terms (5-10 years) continued to range aroundthe midpoint of the inflation target, reflecting the short-term nature of the factors in the decline in expectations for short ranges. In recent days, there was an increase in the probability derived from the Telbor curve that the Bank of Israel interest rate will be reduced in the coming three months. With that, private forecasters expect the Bank of Israel interest rateto remain at its current level in the next few months, and their average forecast for the interest rate in one year remains 0.29 percent, similar to their projections over the previous two months. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity that became available this month support the assessment that the economy is growing at a moderate rate, and that the sharp decline in the growth rate in the second quarter was transitory, despite the slight downward revision in the second estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter. Following a sharp decline in exports in the second quarter, foreign trade data show that the monthly average of goods exports in July-August (in current dollar terms) was 2.8 percent higher than the average for the second quarter, and that goods imports grew by 6 percent duringthe same period. Business services exports increased by 3 percent in July,after declining in June (seasonally adjusted data in dollar terms), and continues to lag behind the growth rate of world trade in services. The current account ended the second quarter with a surplus of $2.6 billion, similarto its level over the past year. The current account was affected positively by the decline in fuel prices and the increase in export prices, and affected negatively by the decline in exports. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.3 percent in August, led by imports of consumer goods, imports of manufacturing inputs, and building starts. The growth rate of the Business Climate Index increased to 0.27 percent in August (comparedto 0.24 percent in July), and there was improvement in domestic-market oriented industries, compared with a decline in manufacturing. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics increased this month compared with the previous month, and is at a relatively high level compared with the beginning of the year. The Purchasing Managers Index increased to 48.1 points, still in the area indicating a contraction in activity. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for August indicated a slight improvement in the employment, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The number of employee posts held byIsraelis increased by 0.3 percent in June, compared with May, and in the second quarter remained unchanged, on average, compared with the first quarter. In the second quarter, nominal wages increased by 0.9 percent, and realwages increased by 1.2 percent, relative to the first quarter (seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts for June-August were 5.7 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year, signaling that wage increases apparently continued in the third quarter. The increase in wages in the past year encompassed all industries, except for the financial services and insurance industry. The job vacancy rate remained high in August, at 3.2 percent. Budget data: In January-August, the domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was about NIS 0.7 billion. Total tax revenues since the beginning of the year are about NIS 5.5 billion higher, and in August they were NIS 2.4 billion higher, than the seasonal path consistent with the tax revenue forecast, against the background of high revenue from real estate, vehicle, and capital gainstaxes. Net of these items, as well, there was an increase in revenues, which is consistent with continued expansion of activity. Since the beginning of the year, gross domestic VAT revenues increased by about 5.6 percent in real terms, compared with the corresponding period in 2014. Since the beginning of the year, government domestic expenditure is about 4.8 percent higher (in real terms) than in the corresponding period last year. Staff forecast: This month, the ResearchDepartment updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. According to the forecast, the inflation rate over the next four quarters is expected to be 0.6 percent, and at the end of 2016 is expected to be 1.4 percent. The Bank of Israel interest rate is expected, according to the staff forecast, to remain at 0.1 percent throughout 2015 and to begin to increase on a lower path than in the previous forecast, to 0.5 percent at the end of 2016; that is, the forecast is that the interest rate will remain lower than the US federal funds rate, as projected by the leadership of the Federal Reserve, for some time. GDP is expected to grow in 2015 by 2.6 percent (compared with 3.0 percent in the previous forecast), and in 2016 it is expected to grow by 3.3 percent (3.7 percent in the previous forecast). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on August 23, 2015, through September 21, 2015, the shekel weakened by about 1.3 percent against the dollar, and by about 1.35 percent against the euro. The shekel weakened by about 1.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on August 23, 2015, through September 21, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 2.9 percent. Yieldsin the government bond market increased for nearly all terms to maturity, with steepening curves. Nominal yields increased by up to 10 basis points for medium-long terms, while yields on the CPI-indexed curve declined slightly for terms of up to 3 years, and increased by up to 12 basis points for terms up to 10 years. There were declines along the makam yield curve, and it was trading slightly below the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined slightly, from 73 basis points to 67 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in August, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 51.4 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 13.8 percent. The credit market: Outstanding debt of the business sector remained unchanged in August, at about NIS 812 billion. Repayments of NIS 2 billion were offset by the net raising of debt and as aresult of the effect of the shekel's depreciation on the balance of debt. In August, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 1.9 billion, below the average over the past 12 months (about NIS 2.2 billion). Issuances were divided among companies in the manufacturing and real estateindustries. Against the background of the volatility in global financial markets, corporate bond market spreads increased in August, but at the beginning of September the start of a downward trend in spreads can be seen. Similarly, mutual funds specializing in shares and corporate bonds saw net withdrawals, followed by net new investment, and overall, at the end of August, the balance of these funds remained virtually unchanged. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 5.4 billion (1.2 percent) in July to about NIS 451 billion, of which outstanding housing debt increased by about NIS 2.9 billion (0.9 percent) to NIS 314 billion. New mortgage volume remained elevated, totaling about NIS 6.2 billion in August, and the monthly average over the past 12 months reached a record of about NIS 5.2 billion. The share of mortgages taken to finance the purchase of an investment home increased by 2 percentage points in July compared with June, to 17.1 percent. This was the sharpest increase since November 2012, against the background of investors bringing purchases forward prior to the increase in purchase tax. Similar to June and July, mortgage interest rates in August increased on all indexation tracks, rising by 0.15 percentage points on the fixed and variable rate CPI-indexed tracks, and by 0.12 percentage points on the fixed-rate unindexed track. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.7 percent in August, and has increased by 2.5 percent over the past 12 months. In May-June, home prices increased by 0.9 percent, and in the 12 months ending in June, they increased by 6.0 percent, of which 4.6 percent was over the past half year. Preliminary data indicate that the number of transactions inJuly was markedly lower than in the preceding two months, against the background of the increase in transactions by investors in those months, due tothe increase in purchase tax. The number of new homes sold in July remained high: about 2,400: and the stock of homes available for sale remains relatively high at around 16,500, though it continues to decline. The number of building starts in the past two years indicates that the number of building completions is expected to remain at a high level in the coming period. The global economy: Advanced economies continued to grow at a moderate rate, while developing economies continue toslow. Global equity markets declined, with considerable volatility. The recovery in the US continues, reflected in the upward revision of GDP growth data for the second quarter, from 2.3 percent to 3.7 percent. Exports were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the dollar, and growth in private consumption was lower than forecast, against the background of only a moderate increase in wages. Weakness can be seen in the manufacturing sector,but the services sector: the main part of the US economy: continues to grow. The federal funds rate was left unchanged, but most members of the Federal Open Market Committee believe that it will increase duringthe remainder of the year, and the probability derived from markets for such an occurrence is about 40 percent. In the eurozone as well, second quarter growth data was revised upward, from 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent. The slow decline in unemployment continues: reaching 10.9 percent: and retail sales were higher than expected. The ECB lowered the inflation and growth forecasts for the next three years, and increased the ceiling for government bond purchases from 25 percent to 33 percent of each series. Therisk from the crisis in Greece has apparently declined. In Japan, there were mixed data, and a further decrease in corporate tax was announced. Developments in China were the focus of most of the attention this month. Macroeconomic data were considered negative in the short term, but are also considered as reflecting a long-term structural change in the Chinese economy. The declines in the Chinese stock market became more severe, and led to manypolicy measures being taken with the aim of moderating them. Real activityin other developing economies continued to moderate, particularly among commodity exporters and among countries that maintain extensive trade ties with China. Inflation is slowing in many economies, and energy and commodity prices indicate a high likelihood that inflation will continue to decline in the short term. After declines in the price of oil during the previous two months, the price stabilized this month, at $48 per barrel at the end of the period, compared with $46 in the previous month. Industrial metals prices increased slightly, and agricultural commodities prices declined slightly. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for October 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, and the exchange rate of the shekel, as well as on monetary policies of major central banks. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The rate of increase in the CPI in recent months has been consistent with achieving the inflation target, although it is expectedthat in the coming months several one-off factors will act to reduce the CPI, and against this background there was an additional decline in short-term inflation expectations this month. To date, there is no evidence that the decline in the inflation environment is a result of moderation in domestic demand. Medium and long-term (forward) expectations remained entrenched near the midpoint of the target range. C 2B 7 Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month support the assessment that the economy is growing at a moderate rate, and that the sharp decline in the growth rate in the second-quarter growth rate derived mainly from transitory factors. Foreign trade data indicate some recovery in the third quarter, but over time the trend of lack of growth in exports, as well as in investment, is worrying. The elevated employment level and low unemployment are consistent with the increase seen in wages. The Research Department's staff forecast for growth in 2015 was reduced by 0.4 percentage points, to 2.6 percent, and was reducedby 0.4 percentage points for 2016, to 3.3 percent. C 2B 7 There are increasing signs of a slowdown in the growthrate of the global economy, with an emphasis on China and other emerging economies. In the US and Europe, moderate recovery continues. Inflation in many countriescontinues to moderate. Monetary policy in major economies remains highly accommodative, and uncertainly continues regarding the date of an initial increase in the US federal funds rate. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on August 23, 2015, through September 21, 2015, the shekel weakened by about 1.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. However, since the beginning of the year there has been an effective appreciation of 4.8 percent. The development of the exchange rate since the beginning of year is weighing on growth of exports and the tradable sector, and is delaying the return of inflation to within the target range. C 2B 7 Robust activity in the housing market continued this month, and was reflected in an especially elevated level of new home sales, and in an acceleration of the rate of price increases, which have risen by 6 percent over the past 12 months. Likewise, the rate of new mortgages taken out remains high. The elevated level of building starts in the past two years supports an increase in housing supply. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target and to growth remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. ________________________________ The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for October 2015 will be published on October 8, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for November 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. October 26, 2015. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor August declined by 0.2 percent, below the average of forecasters' projections, which was for it to remain unchanged. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for October 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.

Ukraine,2015-09-24,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has adopted a decision to cut the NBU's discount rate to 22% per annum, effective from September 25, 2015. NBU Board Resolution No. 627, dated September 24, 2015 On the Money Market Regulation has been issued to this effect. The National Bank of Ukraine moves ahead with plans to ease the monetary policy stance, which was launched last month. A gradual departure from the policy of ""expensive money"" was made possible due to a steady alleviation of the risks to price stability in Ukraine. In July-August, the deflation was observed, with the core inflation standing close to zero. A firm disinflation trend was a result of the joint efforts of the National Bank of Ukraine and the Government. The sound monetary and fiscal policy enabled us to contain the demand-side inflation, stabilize the foreign exchange market and anchor inflationary expectations. The factors contributing to curbing inflation prevail throughout the forecast horizon. They include a stable money market, low world commodity prices, a further decline in inflationary expectations. The latter was underpinned by the completion of the debt operation to restructure Ukraine's sovereign debt, the ongoing successful cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, and support from other international partners. At the same time, scheduled adjustments of administered prices and a long-term increase in wages and social benefits initiated by the Government will not exert significant upward pressure on inflation. In view of the above, according to estimates by the National Bank of Ukraine, inflation is projected to follow a downward path. As a result, the Consumer Price Index growth will moderate to 12% by the end of 2016. In view of the above, the National Bank of Ukraine keeps on easing the monetary policy stance. At the same time, this move is prudent and takes into account the need to remain on a disinflation path and reach a mid-term inflation objective of 5% yoy. Such easing of the monetary policy stance will enable us to underpin a gradual recovery of economic activity, the signs of which are evident in the third quarter and will persist in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, real GDP growth is projected to at 2.4% yoy. Detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on October 1, 2015. The next meeting of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine on monetary policy issues will be held on October 29, 2015 in accordance with the approved schedule."
Colombia,2015-09-25,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 4.75%. The Board took into consideration mainly the following aspects. In August, annual consumer inflation rose, reaching 4.74%. The average of the four measures of core inflation (4.46%) increased again, reaching its highest level since June 2009. Analysts' one and two years inflation expectations are around the top half of the target range, and those embedded in 2, 3 and 5 years public debt bonds are above 4.0%. Pass-through of nominal depreciation to consumer prices and the increase in the cost of imported raw materials, as well as the lower dynamics in food supply, explained to a great extent the acceleration of inflation so far this year. Pass-through of part of the devaluation of the peso to consumer prices and the greater intensity of El Nino have slowed down convergence of inflation to the target, due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations as well as by the probable triggering of indexation mechanisms. Figures for global economic activity continue to reflect a weak dynamics of external demand, below the one recorded in 2014. In the United States, the economy would have continued to grow at favorable rates, while the euro zone is recovering slowly. In China, the slowdown continues and its central bank implemented new measures to stimulate the economy. The major economies of Latin America recorded low growths or contractions in their output. In the United States, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate unaltered. As for Latin America, the risk premia of the major economies remain at levels higher than those of 2014, and the value of their currencies against the US dollar has been volatile. The international price of oil and other commodities exported by Colombia remain at low levels. The fall in the terms of trade recorded throughout the year has deteriorated national income and largely explains the higher level of the exchange rate vis--vis the US dollar. In Colombia, economic growth in the second quarter (3.0%) was slightly better than projected by the technical staff. Domestic demand slowed down mainly in machinery investment and transportation equipment. Private consumption grew at a slower pace. Both exports and imports fell, but their net contribution to GDP growth was positive. Considering this and with the new information of the third quarter, the technical staff maintained the estimated range for economic growth between 1.8% and 3.4%, with 2.8% as the most likely outcome. Explanation of the policy decision. Background. The adjustment of the Colombian economy to the strong income shock derived from the strong fall of the international price of oil has required a substantial depreciation of the peso. This is necessary to reorient sectoral spending and production, leading to adjustment of the country's external accounts. The expectations of an increase in the benchmark interest rates by the US Federal Reserve have generated additional pressures towards depreciation. Due to its magnitude, devaluation has raised inflation in consumer prices. However, this shock is considered transitory, as an additional strong and continuous depreciation is not expected. This impact adds to the temporary shocks in food supply at the beginning of the year. In the light of the transitory nature of all these shocks, and considering the anchoring of inflation expectations to the target, gradual convergence of inflation was expected in the policy horizon without altering the benchmark interest rate. At the same time, a slowdown in the economy was foreseen as a result of the deterioration in the terms of trade. Given the persistence of the less favorable terms of trade and national income, a slowdown in domestic spending was thought to be compatible with sustainability of the country's external accounts. However, the risk that the slowdown could be excessive was recognized, especially in a context of weak external demand. With the information from the last month, the likelihood of this risk has decreased. Under these conditions, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate then to keep interest rates stable at expansionary levels. Current Situation. The new information available shows a continuous and higher-than-expected increase in inflation and core inflation indicators, as well as the appearance of signs of possible unanchoring of inflation expectations. The sharp increases in the prices of goods that are most affected by the depreciation of the peso have continued pressing inflation upwards. Prices of other goods and services also show increasing variations, which may reflect indexation, expectations of higher inflation in the future, or pressures in costs in these sectors. At the same time. El Nino has intensified, increasing the risk of further increases in food and energy prices. As mentioned, inflation expectation indicators increased, and those derived from the prices of short and long term public debt are above 4.0%. Recent data on growth and economic activity confirm a slowdown in production and expenditure in line with the projections of the Central Bank's technical staff, compatible with the correction of the country's external deficit. Policy Decision. The risk of a lasting increase in inflation and unanchoring of inflation expectations has risen, while the risk of an excessive slowdown in economic activity has not exhibited a noticeable change. Under these conditions, given the current expansionary monetary policy stance, the Board of Directors decided to increase by 25 bps Banco de la Republica's benchmark interest rate. With the current information, the Board believes that this increase is consistent with the convergence to the inflation target of 3.0%. The Board reiterates its commitment to the inflation target and continues to carefully monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as that of asset markets and the international situation."
India,2015-09-29,"Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2015-16 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Part A: Monetary Policy Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points from 7.25 per cent to 6.75 per cent with immediate effect; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 14-day term repos as well as longer term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 7.75 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the third bi-monthly statement of August 2015, global growth has moderated, especially in emerging market economies (EMEs), global trade has deteriorated further and downside risks to growth have increased. In the United States, industrial production slowed as capital spending in the energy sector was cut back and exports contracted, weighed down by the strength of the US dollar. Consumer spending stayed buoyant, however, amidst steadily improving labour market conditions. In the Euro area, a fragile recovery strengthened, supported by domestic consumption, less slack in the labour market and improving financial conditions engendered by ultra-accommodative monetary policy. Economic activity in Japan, however, is faltering under the weight of weak private consumption and exports, with both business and consumer confidence subdued. EMEs are caught in a vortex of slowing global trade volumes, depressed commodity prices, weakening currencies and capital outflows, which is accentuating country-specific domestic2 constraints. China's intended rebalancing from investment towards consumption is being hit by the stock market meltdown, slower industrial production and weaker exports. The devaluation of the renminbi on August 11, while mild, has unsettled financial markets across the world. Brazil and Russia are grappling with recession and runaway inflation, while South Africa is facing tightening structural constraints which threaten to tip it into a downturn. Since the Chinese devaluation, equity prices, commodities and currencies have fallen sharply. Capital flight from EMEs into mature bond markets has pushed down developed market yields, and risk spreads across asset classes have widened. Although volatility ebbed in early September and capital flows returned cautiously to some EMEs, sentiment in financial markets remains fragile. The September 17 decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to stay on hold in response to global conditions and weak domestic inflation lifted financial markets briefly, but overall financial conditions are yet to stabilise. In India, a tentative economic recovery is underway, but is still far from robust. In agriculture, sown area has expanded modestly from a year ago, reflecting the timely and robust onset of the monsoon in June, but the southwest monsoon is currently deficient by 14 per cent  with production-weighted rainfall deficiency at 20 per cent. Nevertheless, the first advance estimates indicate that food grain production is expected to be higher than last year, reflecting actions taken to contain the adverse effects of rain deficiency through timely advisories and regular monitoring of seed and fertiliser availability. Allied farm activities, which are more insulated from the monsoon, remain resilient and could partly offset the effects of adverse weather on crop production. Rural demand, however, remains subdued as reflected in still shrinking tractor and two-wheeler sales. Manufacturing has exhibited uneven growth in April-July, with industrial activity slowing sequentially in July, although it has been in expansionary mode for the ninth month in succession. Industries such as apparel, furniture and motor vehicles have experienced acceleration. Furthermore, the resumption of growth in production of consumer durables in recent months, after a protracted period of contraction over the last two years, is indicative of some pick-up in consumption demand, primarily in urban areas. Since our last review, however, external demand conditions have turned weaker, suggesting a more persistent drag from lower exports and cheaper imports due to global overcapacity. This contributes to continuing domestic capacity under- utilisation, decelerating new orders and a rising ratio of finished goods inventories to sales. As a result of still tepid aggregate demand, output price growth is weak, but input material costs have fallen further, leading to an increase in margins for most producers. Weak aggregate demand appears to have more than offset the effect of higher margins to hold back new investment intentions. The expansion in capital goods production, therefore, likely relates more to the revival of stalled projects than to a build-up of the green field pipeline. Survey-based business sentiment has been falling in recent quarters. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) nevertheless remained in expansion territory in August, although it slowed from July due to weak domestic and export order books. In the services sector, construction activity is weakening as reflected in low demand for cement and the large inventory of unsold residential houses in some localities. Rising public expenditure on roads, ports and eventually railways could, however, provide some boost to construction going forward. Lead indicators relating3 to freight and passenger traffic are mixed. In August, the services PMI remained in expansion for the second consecutive month on improving new business, but business expectations remain subdued. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached its lowest level in August since November 2014. The ebbing of inflation in the year so far is due to a combination of low month-on-month increases in prices and favourable base effects. Overall year-on-year food inflation dropped sharply, led by vegetables and sugar. Cereal inflation moderated steadily during April-August, but price pressures in respect of pulses and onions remained elevated. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in August for the second consecutive month, primarily due to the decline in petrol and diesel prices pulling down inflation in transportation. Fares other than for air transport have, however, remained inflexible downwards. Inflation in house rentals increased, but was more than offset by some moderation in the heterogeneous category of services, including education, personal care and effects, and health. Inflation expectations of households remained elevated in double digits likely in response to recent month-on-month increases in the prices of vegetables and pulses. Professional forecasters' inflation expectations eased as credibility built around the January 2016 inflation target. Rural wage growth remains subdued and corporate staff costs decelerated. Liquidity conditions eased considerably during August to mid-September. In addition to structural factors such as deposit mobilisation in excess of credit flow, lower currency demand and pick-up in spending by the government contributed to the surplus liquidity. In response, the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate reverse repos of overnight and longer tenors ranging from 2 to 20 days. As a result, the average net daily liquidity absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from 120 billion in July to 261 billion in August and further to 544 billion in September (up to September 15). Money market rates generally remained below the repo rate. As quarterly tax collections went out of the system from mid-September, deficit conditions returned and the Reserve Bank engaged in average net injections of the order of 544 billion (September 16 to 27), keeping the call money rate close to the repo rate. Some forms of bank credit such as personal loans grew strongly as did non-bank financing flows through commercial paper, public equity issues and housing finance. With the weakening of growth prospects in EMEs and world trade volume growth falling below world GDP growth. India's merchandise exports continued to decline in the first two months of Q2. Imports values also declined, but the sharp fall in international crude oil and gold prices was offset by rising import volumes. Non-oil non-gold imports went back into contraction after recording a marginal pick-up in the previous quarter, although there were higher imports of fertilisers, electronics and pulses. With services exports moderating, the widening of the merchandise trade deficit could lead to a modest increase in the current account deficit (CAD) during Q2. Net capital inflows were buoyed by sustained foreign direct investment and accretion to non-resident deposits, and reduced by portfolio outflows, mainly from equity markets. Foreign exchange reserves rose by US $ 10.4 billion during the first half of 2015-16.4 Policy Stance and Rationale 12. In the bi-monthly policy statement of August, the Reserve Bank indicated that further monetary policy accommodation will be conditioned by the abating of recent inflationary pressures, the full monsoon outturn, possible Federal Reserve actions and greater transmission of its front-loaded past actions. Since then, inflation has dropped to a nine-month low, as projected. Despite the monsoon deficiency and its uneven spatial and temporal distribution, food inflation pressures have been contained by resolute actions by the government to manage supply. The disinflation has been broad-based and inflation excluding food and fuel has also come off its recent peak in June. The Federal Reserve has postponed policy normalisation. Markets have transmitted the Reserve Bank's past policy actions via commercial paper and corporate bonds, but banks have done so only to a limited extent. The median base lending rates of banks have fallen by only about 30 basis points despite extremely easy liquidity conditions. This is a fraction of the 75 basis points of the policy rate reduction during January-June, even after a passage of eight months since the first rate action by the Reserve Bank. Bank deposit rates have, however, been reduced significantly, suggesting that further transmission is possible. Looking forward, inflation is likely to go up from September for a few months as favourable base effects reverse. The outlook for food inflation could improve if the increase in sown area translates into higher production. Moderate increases in minimum support prices should keep cereal inflation muted, while subdued international food price inflation should continue to put downward pressure on the prices of sugar and edible oil, and food inflation more generally. It is important that pro-active supply-side management by the government be in place to head off any food price pressures should they materialise, especially in respect of onion and pulses. The pass-through of the recent depreciation of the rupee will have to be carefully monitored, although benign crude prices should have an offsetting effect. Taking all this into consideration, inflation is expected to reach 5.8 per cent in January 2016, a shade lower than the August projection (Chart 1). The modest pick-up in the growth momentum in the first half of 2015-16 benefited from soft commodity prices, disinflation, comfortable liquidity conditions, some de-clogging of stalled projects, and higher capital expenditure by the central government. Underlying economic activity, however, remains weak on account of the5 sustained decline in exports, rainfall deficiency and weaker than expected momentum in industrial production and investment activity. With global growth and trade slower than initial expectations, a continuing lack of appetite for new investment in the private sector, the constraint imposed by stressed assets on bank lending and waning business confidence, output growth projected for 2015-16 is marked down slightly to 7.4 per cent from 7.6 per cent earlier (Chart 2). Concurrent indicators also suggest that the new GDP series shows higher growth than would the old series, which necessitates recalibrating old measures of potential output and the output gap to the new series. Since our last review, the bulk of our conditions for further accommodation have been met. The January 2016 target of 6 per cent inflation is likely to be achieved. In the monetary policy statement of April 2015, the Reserve Bank said that it would strive to reach the mid-point of the inflation band by the end of fiscal 2017- 18. Therefore, the focus should now shift to bringing inflation to around 5 per cent by the end of fiscal 2016-17. In this context, the weakening of global activity since our last review suggests that commodity prices will remain contained for a while. Still-low industrial capacity utilisation indicates more domestic demand is needed to substitute for weakening global demand in order that the domestic investment cycle picks up. The coming Pay Commission Report could add substantial fiscal stimulus to domestic demand, but the government has reaffirmed its desire to respect its fiscal targets and improve the quality of its spending. Under these circumstances, monetary policy has to be accommodative to the extent possible, given its inflation goals, while recognizing that continuing policy implementation, structural reforms and corporate actions leading to higher productivity will be the primary impetus for sustainable growth. Furthermore, investment is likely to respond more strongly if there is more certainty about the extent of monetary stimulus in the pipeline, even if transmission is slow. Therefore, the Reserve Bank has front-loaded policy action by a reduction in the policy rate by 50 basis points. Given our year-ahead projections of inflation, this ensures one year expected Treasury bill real interest rates of about 1.5-2.0 per cent, which are appropriate for this stage of the recovery. While the Reserve Bank's stance will continue to be accommodative, the focus of monetary action for the near term will shift to working with the Government to ensure that impediments to banks passing on the bulk of the cumulative 125 basis points cut in the policy rate are removed. The Reserve Bank will continue to be6 vigilant for signs that monetary policy adjustments are needed to keep the economy on the target disinflationary path. The fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on December 1, 2015. Part B: Developmental and Regulatory Policies 18. This part of the Statement reviews the Reserve Bank's measures to strengthen the monetary policy framework, make banking structure and practices more efficient, broaden and deepen financial markets, deal with stress in corporate and financial assets, and extend the reach of financial services to all. Monetary Policy Framework 19. Discussions on monetary policy and its institutional and operating framework are set out in Part A of this Statement and the Monetary Policy Report issued along with this Statement. Banking Structure 20. The Reserve Bank has put out for comment draft guidelines for banks on the computation of base rate, based on their marginal cost of funds. Guidelines will be issued by end-November 2015. In March 2015, the Reserve Bank issued a Discussion Paper titled “Large Exposures Framework and Enhancing Credit Supply through Market Mechanism” for stakeholders' comments. The Discussion Paper focused on the need to encourage alternative sources of funding to bank credit for the corporate sector to finance growth. This would also de-risk the balance sheets of banks. Specifically, the paper proposed ways to encourage large corporates with borrowings from the banking system above a cut-off level to tap the market for their working capital and term loan needs. Based on suggestions received from stakeholders, the Reserve Bank will issue a draft circular by end-December 2015. As a part of its supervisory process, the Reserve Bank assesses compliance by banks with extant prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning (IRACP). There have been divergences between banks and the supervisor as regards asset classification and provisioning. In order to bring in greater transparency, better discipline with respect to compliance with IRACP norms as well as to involve other stakeholders, the Reserve Bank will mandate disclosures in the notes to accounts to the financial statements of banks where such divergences exceed a specified threshold. Instructions in this regard are being issued separately. The Union Budget for 2014-15 emphasised the urgent need for convergence of the current Indian accounting standards (IND AS) with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Reserve Bank has recommended to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs a roadmap for the implementation of IND AS by banks and non- banking financial companies from 2018-19 onwards. The Reserve Bank constituted a Working Group (Chairman: Shri Sudarshan Sen) for its implementation. The Report of the Working Group will be placed on the Reserve Bank's website by end-October 2015 for public comments.7 24. At present, the minimum risk weight applicable on individual housing loans is 50 per cent. With a view to improving “affordability of low cost housing” for economically weaker sections and low income groups and giving a fillip to “Housing for All”, while being cognisant of prudential concerns, it is proposed to reduce the risk weights applicable to lower value but well collateralised individual housing loans. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. Banks are permitted to hold investments under the HTM category in excess of the limit of 25 per cent of their total investments, provided the excess comprises only SLR securities and the total SLR securities held under the HTM category are not more than 22 per cent of NDTL. The SLR has been reduced to 21.50 per cent of NDTL with effect from February 7, 2015. To align them, it has been decided to bring down the ceiling on SLR securities under HTM from 22 per cent to 21.50 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning January 9, 2016. Thereafter, both the SLR and the HTM ceiling will be brought down by 0.25 per cent every quarter till March 31, 2017. The Depositor Education and Awareness Fund Scheme, 2014 has been established by transfer of bank deposits and other credit balances that have remained unclaimed for more than 10 years. It envisages grant of financial assistance to applicants selected on the basis of proposals intended to promote depositors' interests. In response to the press release issued on January 9, 2015, the Reserve Bank received 90 applications for financial assistance. The names of successful applicants will be announced by October 1, 2015. The window for inviting applications for availing financial assistance from the fund shall be re-opened. The report of the High Powered Committee (HPC) on UCBs (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi) to examine and recommend permissible business lines, appropriate size, conversion of UCBs into commercial banks and licensing of new UCBs was placed on the Reserve Bank's website on August 20, 2015 for comments and suggestions. Based on the feedback received, the recommendations of the Committee will be considered for implementation during the second half of 2015-16. Cyber security has assumed critical importance across the globe. With the widespread use of new technologies, inter-connectedness and dependency, newer risks, threats and vulnerabilities have emerged. The Reserve Bank is setting up an information technology (IT) subsidiary to assist in monitoring the preparedness of banks and identifying systemic vulnerabilities along with aiding the Reserve Bank in its own cyber initiatives. The Reserve Bank will update all its master regulations, and streamline the required procedure for compliance with the regulations by January 1, 2016. All master regulations will be fully updated and placed online. The Reserve Bank will also work to improve clarity in regulatory communications. Financial Markets 30. With the objective of having a more predictable regime for investment by the foreign portfolio investors (FPI), the medium term framework (MTF) for FPI limits in debt securities, worked out in consultation with the government, is set out below. The limits for FPI investment in debt securities will henceforth be announced/ fixed in rupee terms.8 The limits for FPI investment in the central government securities will be increased in phases to 5 per cent of the outstanding stock by March 2018. In aggregate terms, this is expected to open up room for additional investment of 1,200 billion in the limit for central government securities by March 2018 over and above the existing limit of 1,535 billion for all government securities (G-sec). Additionally, there will be a separate limit for investment by FPIs in the State Development Loans (SDLs), to be increased in phases to reach 2 per cent of the outstanding stock by March 2018. This would amount to an additional limit of about 500 billion by March 2018. The increase in limits will be announced every half year in March and September and released every quarter. The existing requirement of investments being made in G-sec (including SDLs) with a minimum residual maturity of three years will continue to apply. Limits for the residual period of the current financial year would be increased in two tranches from October 12, 2015 and January 1, 2016. Each tranche would entail an increase in limits as under: 130 billion for central government securities composed of 75 billion for long term investors and 55 billion for others 35 billion for SDL open to all FPI investors. A circular with details of the MTF is being issued separately. In the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2015-16, announced on April 07, 2015, it was proposed to permit Indian corporates that are eligible to raise external commercial borrowings (ECB) to issue rupee bonds in overseas centres with an appropriate regulatory framework. Based on the comments received on the draft framework and in consultation with the Government, it has been decided to permit Indian corporates to issue rupee denominated bonds with a minimum maturity of five years at overseas locations within the ceiling of foreign investment permitted in corporate debt (US$ 51 billion at present). There shall be no restriction on the end use of funds except a small negative list. Detailed instructions are being issued separately. The Reserve Bank has placed the draft framework on ECB on its website on September 23, 2015 for comments/ feedback. The revised framework suiting the current economic and business environment will replace the extant ECB policy. Scheduled commercial banks and primary dealers (PDs) are currently permitted to execute the sale leg of short sale transactions in the over the counter (OTC) market in addition to the Negotiated Dealing SystemOrder Matching (NDS- OM) platform. Short sale in the OTC market is, however, not permitted between the primary member (PM) and its gilt account holder (GAH). The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CClL) has introduced a facility in the reported segment of NDS-OM which captures details of transactions involving gilt accounts. Accordingly, it is proposed to permit short sale by a PM to its GAH and also to treat purchase by a PM from its9 GAH as a cover transaction. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-October 2015. There has been significant improvement in market infrastructure in the inter- bank repo market in G-sec. This enables Reserve Bank to review restrictions placed on repo transactions, particularly relating to the participation of gilt account holders in the repo market, guided by the recommendations of the Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi). New guidelines in this regard will be issued by end- November 2015. When Issued (WI) trading in G-sec was permitted in 2006 to facilitate the distribution process by stretching the actual distribution period for each issue and allowing the market more time to absorb large issues without disruption. In order to encourage trading in the WI market, it is proposed to: permit the scheduled commercial banks to take short positions in the WI market for both new and reissued securities, subject to limits and other conditions in place from time to time; and permit regulated entities other than banks and primary dealers (PDs) to take long positions in the WI market. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-November 2015. Guidelines on repo in corporate debt were issued in January 2010. In order to further develop the repo market, a broad framework for introduction of electronic dealing platform/s for repo in corporate bonds will be designed in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). While the currency futures market has grown, participation in this segment has been restricted to a few categories of entities. In order to diversify the participation profile in the currency futures market, stand-alone PDs will be permitted to deal in currency futures contracts traded on the recognised exchanges, subject to adherence to certain risk control measures and without diluting their existing obligations in the G- sec market. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-November 2015. At present, exchange traded currency derivatives include futures and options in four currency pairs viz. USD-INR. EUR-INR. GBP-INR and JPY-INR. With a view to enabling direct hedging of exposures in foreign currencies and to permit execution of cross-currency strategies by market participants, exchange traded currency futures and options will be introduced in three cross-currency pairs viz. EUR-USD. GBP- USD and USD-JPY. Necessary guidelines will be issued in consultation with SEBI by end-November 2015. Establishing underlying exposure through verifiable documentary evidence has been a key regulatory requirement for accessing OTC forex markets. To provide more flexibility to market participants in managing their currency risk in the OTC market and for making hedging easier, it has been decided to increase the limit for resident entities for hedging their foreign exchange exposure in the OTC market from US$ 250,000 to US$ one million without the production of any underlying documents, subject to submission of a simple declaration. It is further proposed to comprehensively review the documentation related requirements in the OTC market. The possibility of participation by financially sophisticated investors up to certain10 limits in currency markets without underlying exposure will also be examined. Revised draft of the existing framework will be issued for public comments by end- December 2015. Currency Management 40. With growing financial inclusion, there are concerted efforts to enhance the use of technology and move towards a “less-cash” society. In order to promote electronic payments and use of cards for transactions, the Reserve Bank will put in the public domain a concept paper for proliferation of card acceptance infrastructure in the country, especially in the tier III to tier VI centres, by end-November 2015. The Reserve Bank has issued 100, 500 and 1000 denomination banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi Series2005 with a new numbering pattern with ascending order of the size of the numbers from left to right. This is being introduced in a phased manner for all denominations of banknotes. With a view to making identification of banknotes easier for visually challenged persons, the process for introduction of additional identification marks in banknotes in the form of angular bleed lines has been initiated and is being introduced in the denominations of 100, 500 and 1000 as raised lines on both the left and right sides of the obverse of the banknote: 4 lines in 100, 5 lines in 500 and 6 lines in 1000. Furthermore, the size of the existing identification mark in these denominations is also being increased by 50 per cent to facilitate better identification."
Romania,2015-09-30,"The latest statistical data reveal a further fall of the annual inflation rate in negative territory, due to lower volatile prices  of fuels and food items , and a relative slowdown of the economic growth rate, also as a result of poorer performance of the agricultural sector. The broadening of the scope of the 9 percent VAT rate to all food items and public food services, which since June has impacted the prices of nearly 30 percent of the goods and services included in the consumer basket, led to an annual inflation rate of -1.9 percent in August 2015. Average annual inflation rate dropped to 0.3 percent in August 2015, while the relevant measure for assessing convergence with the European Union, i.e. the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, slipped to 0.5 percent, from 0.7 percent in the previous month. Despite the relative slowdown of the economic growth rate, data illustrate a pick-up in private consumption and investment growth, bolstered by the recovery of lending in local currency, to households in particular, along with a sizeable advance in unit wage costs across the industrial sector. Monetary indicators confirm the fact that the annual change in non-government credit has re-entered positive territory following the expansion in leu-denominated loans. The composition of private sector loans has further changed in favour of the local currency component, whose share in total credit (49.3 percent, against an all-time low of 35.6 percent in May 2012) nears that of foreign currency loans, thereby contributing to the consolidation of monetary policy transmission and the adequate management of risks to financial stability. The international environment is still marked by uncertainty, despite the recent alleviation of global tensions, given that world economic growth remains fragile and volatility on external financial markets may increase amid the divergence between the monetary policy stances of major central banks worldwide. On the domestic front, the macroeconomic policy mix is conditional on the manner in which the recently approved or announced fiscal and budgetary measures (the new Tax Code and pay rises) will be transposed into the 2016 budget configuration and execution. The short-term outlook points to ongoing temporary disinflationary effects of supply-side factors (the impact of the VAT rate cut, developments in fuel prices, etc.). However, these effects might mask the build-up of medium-term inflationary pressures stemming from the still uncertain prospects of the fiscal policy stance and of the match between wage increases and labour productivity gains, as well as from global developments, likely to affect investor perception towards the Romanian economy. In light of the above and based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term in a manner supportive of economic growth within a sustainable macroeconomic environment, while safeguarding financial stability. To this end, a balanced monetary and fiscal policy mix and the progress in structural reforms are pivotal to preserving macro-stability, ensuring lasting economic growth, further convergence with the European Union, as well as to enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to potential shocks or adverse conditions worldwide. The NBR monitors both domestic developments and the international economic environment so as  via the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools  to ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. In line with the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 5 November 2015.  Video: Press briefing, 30 September 2015 (Romanian only)."
Armenia,2015-10-02,"PRESS RELEASE 10.02.2015 At the February 10, 2015 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to raise the refinancing rate by 1.0 percentage point to 10.5%. Inflation in January 2015 was 2.5%, with the 12‐month inflation rate in late January having amounted to 4.3%, staying close to the target. The Board believes that the 12‐month inflation rate would post a slight increase in the coming months due to a lower base compared to the same reference period last year but it would come back to the target afterwards. In 2014, the external sector saw acceleration of the U.S. economic growth rates along with expectations for the rise in interest rates, contributing to the appreciating U.S. dollar and falling prices of commodities and food products in international markets. These developments have led to increased risks to investing in developing countries, which gave rise to high volatility in currency markets, grown interest rates and slowing economic growth in developing countries. The Board evaluates that the developments in Armenia's financial and commodity markets due to the aforementioned developments at the end last year and geopolitical situation in the region are gradually phasing out. In such circumstances, the Board finds it appropriate to cut short‐term market rates which are currently shaped around the Lombard repo rate, by reducing the CBA Lombard Repo Facility rate by 2.5 percentage points to 14.5%. With a return to normal conditions, the short‐term market rates will drop to approach the refinancing rate, which had risen to 10.5%, reflecting increased investment risks and interest rate trends in developing countries over the longer term. The Board agrees that these actions will reduce the spread of the policy rate of the Central Bank and the short‐term market rates, contributing to the stabilization in the financial market and the fulfillment of the inflation target in the medium term. Detailed information based on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Inflation Report of the Central Bank (Monetary Policy Program. Q1, 2015), due on February 20, 2015. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… Press Service of the Central Bank."

Poland,2015-10-06,"Warsaw, 6 October 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 October 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 1.75% on an annual basis. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate. In the euro area, the recovery continues and the latest data point to stable GDP growth in this economy. Also in the United States, data indicate a further rise in economic activity. At the same time, in China economic conditions continue to deteriorate, while Russia and Brazil remain in recession. Therefore, concerns about the economic growth outlook in the emerging market economies persist, which increases uncertainty about economic conditions worldwide. Inflation abroad remains very low and in many countries it declined again, driven mainly by a renewed fall of commodity prices in recent months. In the euro area, price growth has turned negative again and the forecasts for the coming quarters have been revised downwards. Against this background, the Federal Reserve and the ECB are keeping their interest rates close to zero. The ECB also continues its asset purchase programme and signals its extension. At the same time, the Federal Reserve indicates a likely increase in interest rates. The uncertainty about monetary policy of major central banks and concerns about the outlook for economic growth in emerging market economies are causing elevated volatility in global financial markets. In Poland, stable economic growth continues, driven mainly by rising domestic demand, which is supported by favourable labour market developments, consumer confidence and financial standing of enterprises, as well as by stable lending growth. Recently released economic activity indicators were lower than expected, but their decline will probably prove temporary. As demand is growing at a moderate pace and the output gap is still negative, there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Both annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative and declined slightly last month. Deflation has deepened mainly due to falling commodity prices in global markets. Amidst moderate 1/2 wage growth, this contains the risk of increasing cost pressure. Inflation expectations are still very low. In the Council's view, price growth will increase slowly in the coming quarters, supported by the expected closing of the output gap amid improving economic conditions in the euro area and favourable domestic labour market developments. At the same time, persisting risk of stronger economic slowdown in the emerging market economies, low commodity prices and weaker inflation outlook abroad result in increased uncertainty about the pace of inflation returning to the target. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged."
Chile,2015-10-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 October 2015 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.25%. Internationally, following the Federal Reserve meeting, the dollar depreciated multilaterally and the prices of most of the risky assets increased. However, market volatility remains high. Aditionally, risks persist regarding the evolution of the Chinese economy, and doubts about the performance of some Latin American countries—particularly Brazil—have increased. Commodity prices showed mixed movements during the month. On the domestic front. September's CPI inflation was lower than expected, although annual inflation—headline and core—is expected to remain high, in line with forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. Inflation expectations two years ahead are at 3%, and their evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. In August, activity fell short of expectations, with a surprise coming from the mining sector. Demand indicators are still weak. Confidence indicators posted a marginal increase, but remain in pessimistic territory. Private job creation is still dynamic and annual wage growth has slowed. The future path of the monetary policy rate considers additional adjustments aimed to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2015-10-15,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the improvements in the euro area have continued as well. Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility due for example to a shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, although domestic demand activities such as consumption and investment have shown trends of recovery, the trend of declining exports has persisted while the improvement in economic agents' sentiments has been inadequate. On the employment front, as the number of persons employed increased in September, the employment-to-population ratio rose compared to that in September of last year while the unemployment rate maintained the same level. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation fell to 0.6% in September, from 0.7% in August, owing mainly to slowdowns in the rates of agricultural product price increase and to declines in petroleum product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices registered 2.1%, the same as in August. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have accelerated, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen, in line mostly with the subsiding of instabilities in the Chinese financial and foreign exchange markets and with expectations of a delay in the policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. Long- term market interest rates have fallen, in response mainly to interest rate movements in major countries. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as any changes in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy or in economic conditions in emerging market countries including China, as well as the trends of capital flows."
Peru,2015-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2015 BCRP MAINTAINS THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.50 percent given that the inflation forecasts considered in the Monetary Program for September are currently still valid. The level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the target range in 2016 and takes into account that: inflation expectations gradually converge towards the target range; inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors, such as the rise in the prices of some food products and utility rates, and by the depreciation of the nuevo sol against the dollar, the effect of these factors not being foreseen to extend in a general manner to the rest of prices; international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets, and economic activity has been recovering gradually. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and stands ready to make adjustments in its monetary policy rate to lead inflation to the target range in the policy horizon, should it be necessary. Inflation in September recorded a rate of 0.03 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation decreased from 4.04 percent in August to 3.90 in September. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of perishable food products, meals outside the home, and electricity rates, offset in part by the lower prices of fuels. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.06 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 3.48 percent in August to 3.45 percent in September. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations show an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels, but with a faster pace of growth in the second half of the year. It is estimated that the economy would be growing at rates similar to those of the potential output in 2016. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.25 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on November 12, 2015."
Hungary,2015-10-20,"At its meeting on 20 October 2015, the MonetaryCouncil reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted toleave the central bank base rate unchanged at 1.35%. Inthe Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue.While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity inthe economy, and therefore the domestic real economicenvironment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains substantiallybelow the Bank's target. The Bank'smeasures of underlying inflation indicate moderate inflationary pressures inthe economy. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as a result of anexpansion in domestic demand and rises in wages, but the persistently low costenvironment contains the increase in consumer prices. The stabilisation ofinflation expectations around the target is likely to support that price andwage-setting will be consistent with the inflation target over the medium termas the output gap closes. Inflationis expected to move to positive territory in the coming months, but to remainsubstantially below the 3 per cent target, and is only likely to rise to levelsaround 3 per cent at the end of the forecast horizon. Domestic economic growth continued inthe second quarter of 2015. Based on the monthly macroeconomic indicators,underlying growth did not change significantly. Industrial production rose inAugust 2015 relative to a year earlier. The dynamics of retail sales have beenstable in recent months, with their volume increasing across a wide range ofproducts. Employment rose further while the unemployment rate was unchanged asactivity increased. Domestic demand is making an increasing contribution to economicgrowth. Government investment is likely to fall as funding from the EU declinesconsiderably, the impact of which is expected to be mitigated by the gradualpick-up in private sector investment. Domestic economic growth is likely tocontinue, in line with the latest Inflation Report projection. Sentimentin global financial markets has been volatile over the period since theCouncil's latest policy decision, but this has had little impact on domesticindicators. During thefirst half of the period, uncertainty about the interest rateincrease by the Fed and concerns over growth prospects in emerging economieshad a negative impact on global appetite for risk. Global financial market environmentimproved in the second half of the period as market expectations of the Fed's interestrate increase were postponed. Hungarianfinancial markets were relatively calm in the period, with the forintappreciating slightly against the euro. The domestic CDS spread and long-termgovernment bond yields have decreased since the previous policy decision. Marketexpectations have moved in line with the Bank's forward guidance announced inSeptember and are consistent with maintaining the base rate unchanged over theentire forecast horizon. Hungary's persistently strongexternal financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt arecontributing to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council'sassessment, a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due touncertainty in the global financial environment. In theCouncil's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity inthe economy. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate,while the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually over thepolicy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, thecurrent level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for anextended period, over the entire forecast horizon, are consistent with themedium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree ofsupport to the economy."
Turkiye,2015-10-21," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remained weak in the first half of the year, while domestic demand contributed to growth moderately. The composition of growth is expected to shift gradually towards net exports in upcoming periods with the support of rising demand from the European Union economies. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the impact of the uncertainty in domestic and global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and food prices, the Committee decided to maintain the tight liquidity stance as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Euroarea,2015-10-22,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Bonnici for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchases are proceeding smoothly and continue to have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. The Governing Council has been closely monitoring incoming information since our meeting in early September. While euro area domestic demand remains resilient, concerns over growth prospects in emerging markets and possible repercussions for the economy from developments in financial and commodity markets continue to signal downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. Most notably, the strength and persistence of the factors that are currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term require thorough analysis. In this context, the degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our December monetary policy meeting, when the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections will be available. The Governing Council is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate if warranted in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. In particular, the Governing Council recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration. In the meantime, we will continue to fully implement the monthly asset purchases of €60 billion. These purchases are intended to run until the end of September 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment of the available information in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2015, following a rise of 0.5% in the previous quarter. The outcome for the second quarter reflected positive contributions from both domestic demand and net exports. The most recent survey indicators point to a broadly similar pace of real GDP growth in the third quarter of the year. Overall, we expect the economic recovery to continue, albeit dampened, in particular, by weaker than expected foreign demand. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, the decline in oil prices should provide support for households' real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. However, the recovery in domestic demand in the euro area continues to be hampered by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside, reflecting in particular the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in emerging market economies, which have the potential to further weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports. Increased uncertainty has recently manifested itself in financial market developments, which may have negative repercussions for euro area domestic demand. According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation was -0.1% in September 2015, down from 0.1% in August. Compared with the previous month, this mainly reflects a further decline in energy price inflation. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation rates will remain very low in the near term. Annual HICP inflation is expected to rise at the turn of the year, also on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. Inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further during 2016 and 2017, supported by the expected economic recovery, the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate and the assumption of somewhat higher oil prices in the years ahead as currently reflected in oil futures markets. However, there are risks stemming from the economic outlook and from financial and commodity market developments which could further slow down the gradual increase in inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. These risks are being closely monitored by the Governing Council. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (M3), notwithstanding a decline in the annual growth rate of M3 to 4.8% in August 2015 from 5.3% in July. Annual growth in M3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 11.4% in August, after 12.2% in July. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.4% in August, up from 0.3% in July, pursuing its gradual recovery since the beginning of 2014. Despite these improvements, developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors, and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.0% in August 2015, compared with 0.9% in July. The euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2015 confirms the increase in demand for bank loans, supported by the general level of interest rates, financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects. In addition, credit standards eased further on loans to enterprises, notably due to increasing competitive pressures in retail banking, while tightening somewhat on loans to households for house purchase. Overall, the monetary policy measures we have put in place since June 2014 provide clear support for improvements both in borrowing conditions for firms and households and in credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates the need to firmly implement the Governing Council's monetary policy decisions and to monitor closely all relevant incoming information as concerns their impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the benefits of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the EU's fiscal rules. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial for confidence in our fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Israel,2015-10-26,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor September declined by 0.4 percent, a slightly smaller decline than theaverage of forecasters' projections, which was for a decline of 0.5 percent. There was a marked increase in the prices of fruit and vegetables (7.6 percent). One-off factors led to a decline of 1.9 percent in the education, culture and entertainment component against the background of the cancellation of the television fee; a decline of 1.2 percent in household maintenance mainly against the background of the decline in electricity prices; and a decline of 1.2 percent in the transportation and communications component against the background of the decline in fuel prices. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.5 percent, compared with an inflation rate of negative 0.4 percent over the 12 months that ended in August. CPI components representing tradable goods declined by 2.4 percent over the past 12 months, and CPI components representing nontradable items increased by 0.7 percent. The CPI excluding energy prices and administrative price declines (such as the decline inwater and electricity prices) increased by 1 percent over the past 12 months. The effect of the VAT reduction and the decline in electricity prices are expected to reduce the CPI by a combined 0.4 percent in October and November. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations remained stable this month, and in some cases showed a slight increase: Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings increased from 0.4 percent to 0.65 percent, and expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates remained around 0.2 percent. Twelve-months ahead inflation expectations derived from the capital market remained around 0.4 percent, and expectations for 2 years remained at 0.8 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) forward expectations increased by 0.4 percentage points to 1.8 percent, while forward expectations for longer terms (5-10 years) continued to maintain stability, ranging around the midpoint of the inflation target. The Telbor curve indicates thatthere is no change expected in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next year. Private forecasters expect the Bank of Israel interest rate to remain at its current level in the next few months, and to increase in about a year. Real economic activity: Third quarter data are consistent with the assessment that the economy is continuing to grow at the moderate rate that has characterized the past few years. Growth isbeing led by private consumption, with continued weakness in exports. The net balance of the Companies Survey, which remained virtually unchanged in the third quarter, similar to the previous two quarters, supports this assessment. Past experience shows that the wave of violence may have an impact on private consumption and on tourism, but if it does not last long, the effect is expected to be moderate. Goods exports (seasonally adjusted, in current dollars, excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) declined by 8 percentin September, cutting off the recovery that was recorded in July and August compared to the second quarter. Imports declined by 9 percent, inter aliaagainst the background of the announcement of a VAT reduction in October. In the past two years. Israeli export performance (goods and services) has been lower than trade performance of the OECD countries, following a few years in which Israeli exports outperformed them. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.1 percent in September, lower than the pace ofincrease in previous months, mainly due to the decline in goods imports and exports in September. The Business Climate Index declined slightly in September, but indicates a stable growth rate in the past few quarters, with aslight acceleration in the industries active in the domestic market and a decline in the tradable industries. The Consumer Confidence Indices were revised before the start of the wave of violence: the index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics declined in September, but is higher than at the beginning of the year, and the index compiled by Bank Hapoalim increased slightly. The Purchasing Managers Index declined slightly in September. The labor market: The number of employeeposts increased by 0.25 percent in July. Nominal wages increased by 0.4 percent, and real wages increased by 1.3 percent, in May-July, relative to February-April (seasonally adjusted data). Since the beginning of the year, there has been an acceleration in the pace of wage increases. Health tax receipts for July-September were 4.7 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. Data for previous months were revised downward, but even the revised data indicate an acceleration following the temporary slowdown during 2014. The job vacancy rate continued to increase in September, reaching 3.4 percent. The downward trend in unemployment and the increase in the number of job vacancies in the past year support the assessment that the improvement in the labor market reflects increased demand. Budget data: In January-September, the domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was about NIS 1 billion. Total tax revenues since the beginning of the year are about NIS 5.3 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the taxrevenue forecast, while tax revenue in September continues to signal expansion of activity, with direct taxes increasing by 18.4 percent in real terms. With that, there was a decline of 2.7 percent in indirect tax revenue inSeptember, for seasonal reasons. Gross domestic VAT revenues increased by about 11.8 percent in real terms since the beginning of the year, compared with the corresponding period in 2014. Since the beginning of the year, government domestic expenditure is about 5.1 percent higher (in nominal terms)than in the corresponding period last year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on September 21, 2015, through October 23, 2015, the shekel strengthened by about 1.1 percent against the dollar, and by about 2.5 percent against the euro. The shekel strengthened by about 1.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on September 21, 2015, through October 23, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 2.2 percent.Yields in the government bond market declined for nearly all terms to maturity. Nominal yields declined by up to 20 basis points for medium-long terms, while yields on the CPI-indexed curve increased slightly for terms of upto 3 years, and declined by up to 21 basis points for medium-long terms. The makam yield curve continues to trade around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased slightly, from 71 basis points to 75 basis points. Ingeneral, the worsening of the security situation has thus far barely been reflected in the financial markets. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in September, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 50.6 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 15.1 percent. The credit market: Outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 10 billion (1.2 percent) in August, to about NIS 824 billion. The increase derived mainly from the effect ofthe shekel's depreciation on outstanding debt. In September, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 3 billion, higher than the average over the past 12 months (about NIS 2.2 billion). Most of the issuances were by companies in the real estate industry and in the trade and services industry. Against the background of the volatility in global financial markets, corporate bond market spreads increased in September. Mutual funds saw continued withdrawals in September and in the first three weeksof October, similar to the four previous months, with an emphasis on mutual funds specializing in government bonds, general bonds and shekel-denominated money market funds. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 4 billion (0.9 percent) in August to about NIS 455 billion, of which outstanding housing debt increased by about NIS 2.8 billion (0.9 percent) to NIS 317 billion. There was a decline, mostly seasonal, in new mortgage volume, which totaled about NIS 4.2 billion in September. Mortgage interest rates continued to increase on all indexation tracks in September, particularlyin the CPI-indexed track, rising by 0.08 percentage points on the fixed rate CPI-indexed track and by 0.13 percentage points on the variable rate CPI-indexed track. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.1 percent in September, and has increased by 2.6 percent over the past 12 months. In July-August, home prices declined by 0.4 percent, while data for the previous months were revised upward, and in the 12 months ending in August, theyincreased by 6.2 percent. Preliminary data for August indicate a further decline in the number of transactions, against the background of the increase in transactions by investors in June, due to the increase in purchase tax. The number of new homes sold between June and August reached record levels of about 3,000 per month (including public construction). In July-August the increase in the number of homes for sale resumed, and the high rate of building starts in the past year is expected to be reflected in ahigh level of building completions in the coming period. The global economy: Data that became available this month show that the global economic recovery is slowing, mainlyagainst the background of developments in the emerging markets. The International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2016 from 3.8 percent to 3.6 percent, and the growth forecast for global trade from 4.4 percent to 4.1 percent. The OECD's index of composite leading indicators shows a continued slowdown in the coming months. Inflation in many markets remains low. The delay in the markets' assessment regarding the timing of an interest rate increase in the US, as well as expectations offurther accommodative measures in Europe and Japan, led to price increaseson the financial markets. In the US, there is an apparent slowdown and theGDPNow index shows growth of only 0.9 percent in the third quarter. Manufacturing activity in the US weakened against the background of the strong dollar, a mixed picture is apparent in the real estate industry, and the vehicle industry is showing relative strength. Some of the leaders of the Fed still believe that the interest rate will start to rise this year, but the markets' believe that the likelihood of this happening has declined.In September, just 142 thousand jobs were added in the US labor market, the decline in the labor force participation rate continued, and the hourly wage remained unchanged. Activity data in Europe were mostly disappointing, particularly data on the German economy: which is negatively affected by the weakness in its export destinations, chiefly China: and there is concern of a significant negative impact on the motor vehicle industry due to events at Volkswagen. Against the background of weak growth and inflation, the assessment that the ECB will take additional accommodative measures has gained strength, particularly following the most recent speech bythe ECB president. The risk of the crisis in Greece worsening has declined. In Japan as well, the activity indices disappointed, and inflation remains low, creating expectations of additional accommodative measures. Second quarter growth in China was 6.9 percent, very close to the government target. However, various indicators show a slowdown in growth, and inflation remains low. The central bank again lowered its interest rate and the reserve ratio required of the banks. Commodities prices remained low this month, with Brent crude oil trading at $48 per barrel, similar to the previous month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. In view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in theexchange rate, and in the monetary policy of the major central banks, the Monetary Committee's assessment is that monetary policy will remainaccommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The inflation environment in the short term is affected by factors of a one-time nature. Short-term inflation expectations remained low this month, and are affected by these factors and by the recent stabilization of commodities prices. Medium-term (forward) expectations increased, and long-term (forward) expectations remained anchored near the midpoint of the target range. C 2B 7 Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month support the assessment that the economy is growing at a moderate rate, led by private consumption, with continued weakness in exports.Labor market data indicate continued improvement in the labor market. Pastexperience shows that the wave of violence may have an effect on private consumption and on tourism, but that if it does not last long, the effect isexpected to be moderate. C 2B 7 The International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth and global trade forecasts for 2016, mainly in view of developments in the emerging markets. The interest rate in a number of economies was lowered this month, and market assessments are that monetary policy in the major economies will remain accommodative, and that accommodation is even expected to increase in some of them. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on September 21, 2015, through October 23, 2015, the shekel strengthened by about 1.1 percentin terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Since the beginning of the year there has been an effective appreciation of 5.9 percent. The development of the exchange rate since the beginning of year is weighing on growthof exports and the tradable sector, and is delaying the return of inflation to within the target range. C 2B 7 There was a decline in home prices this month, but over the past 12 months they have increased by 6.2 percent. There is a marked increase in the sale of new homes and in the stock of homes available for sale. The volume of new mortgages taken out remains high. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high and the risks to growth have increased. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for November 2015 will be published on November 9, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for December 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. November 23, 2015."
Russia,2015-10-28,"On 28 October 2016, the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decidedto keep thekeyrate at 10.00 per annum. The Boardof Directors notes that the dynamics of inflation and economic activity areoverall in line with the forecast. At the same time, inflation is slowing downto a great extent on the back of temporary factors, while deceleration ininflation expectations remains unsteady. For the trend towards inflationslowdown to become sustainable, according to Bank of Russia estimates, it isnecessary to hold the current key rate throughout 2016, with its potentialdowngrades due in 2017 Q1-Q2. Given this decision and considering that themoderately tight monetary policy is maintained, annual growth in consumerprices is set to total less than 4.5% for October 2017, dropping to the targetlevel of 4% by the end of 2017. When making its key rate decisions in themonths ahead, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks alongsidewith the alignment of inflation dynamics and economic performance with thebaseline forecast. In makingits key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors wasguided by the following considerations:. First.Annual inflation continues its decline in line with the Bank of Russia'sbaseline forecast; however, this is largely due to temporary factors. Estimatesas of 24 October indicate that annual consumer price growth was down to 6.2% from6.4% seen in September. A meaningful contribution to the inflation reduction ismade by the performance of the ruble exchange rate as oil prices have beenhigher than expected and Russian financial assets are becoming more attractiveto external investors. Also, the good harvest helped lower food pricegrowth. The disinflationary impact of domestic demand is however going down,which translates into slower deceleration of non-food product prices.Households have thus far been abiding by a saving-oriented model of behaviour.However, tentative signs of rising real wages may contribute to a gradualrecovery in demand for goods and services. The key rate held at the currentlevel long enough is expected to determine monetary conditions further on,which are critical to support incentives to save and shore up the trend towardssustainable inflation reduction, impacted by demand-side constraints. This willenable a further decline in inflation expectations. Considering the decisionmade and the maintenance of moderately tight monetary policy, the Bankof Russia forecasts that annual inflation will stand at less than4.5% in October 2017, thereafter reaching the 4% target by late2017. Second.The further path of the key rate outlined by the Bank ofRussia in September sought to adjust expectations of market participants, whoforecast faster key rate reduction and slower inflation decline than predictedby the Bank of Russia. The announcement shifted the yield curve upwards in thefinancial market and preserved moderately tight monetary conditions. However, inflationexpectations of market actors for late 2017 hold above the Bank of Russia's 4%inflation target. The correction of the level of interestrates in the financial market was responsible for preserving moderatelytight monetary conditions, expected to remain in the economy long enough.Positive real interest rates will be held at a level which, while securingdemand for credit, will exclude heightened inflationary pressure and keepincentives to save. Tentative signs of recovery in consumer lending do not bearsubstantial inflation risks so far given that a considerable part of currentloans is used to refinance previously extended loans. Third.The revival of production remains unstable and varies acrossindustries and regions. The Bank of Russia estimates that moderately tightmonetary conditions do not hinder economic recovery, with structural factorsbeing the main restrictions. The labour market is adjusting to the new economicenvironment, and unemployment remains stable and low. Import substitution is progressingand certain items of non-commodity exports show an upward trend. Industry,including high-techproduction, findsnew growthfactors. However,they are still unable to ensure that overall production dynamics remainssustainably positive. At the same time, individual industries are stagnant orshow lower output growth. The emerging signs of recovery in investment activityare persistently weak. Positive trends need time to develop and root. The year2016 will see an overall 0.5-0.7% drop in the output of goods and services, whilethe fourth quarter is expected to post a slight quarterly growth. In 2017, economicgrowth will be low (under 1%). This forecast is based on conservativeassumptions about low growth of the global economy, average oil prices of about$40 per barrel, moderate capital outflow, and persistent structuralrestrictions of Russian economic development. Fourth.Risks remain that the 4% inflation target may not be reached in 2017. This mainlyresults from inertial inflation expectations, possible weakening of households'propensity to save, and higher real wages not supported with a rise in labourproductivity. No legislative decision has yet been taken with regard tospecific medium-term fiscal consolidation measures, including the indexation ofwages in the public sector and social benefits. Volatility of global commodityand financial markets may also have a negative impact on exchange rate andinflation expectations. TheBank of Russia estimates that the key rate needs to be maintained at thecurrent level until the end of 2016 and can be cut in 2017 Q1-Q2 to anchor thedownward inflation trend. The Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks andcompliance of economic performance and inflation with the baseline scenariowhen it makes its key rate decision in the upcoming months. TheBank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate reviewmeeting on 16December 2016.

United States,2015-10-28,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady. Nonetheless, labor market indicators, on balance, show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring global economic and financial developments. Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Dennis P Lockhart; Jerome H Powell; Daniel K Tarullo; and John C Williams. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting."
Egypt,2015-10-29,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release October 29, 2015 In its meeting held on October 29, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 925 percen. Headline CPI increased by 247 percent (m/m) in September following 063 percent in August, leading the annual rate to jump to 921 percent from 788 percen. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 079 percent in September compared to a decline of 023 percent in August, while the annual rate remained largely unchanged at 555 percent, on the back of a favorable base effect from the previous yea. The continued acceleration in the prices of volatile food items explain the bulk of monthly headline CPI developments and has widened the divergence between the headline and core inflation rate. Upside risks to the inflation outlook from domestic supply shocks are largely mitigated by contained imported inflation, against the background of broad-based declines in international commodity price. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 30 percent (y/y) in 2014/15 Q3 to record 46 percent (y/y) in the first nine months of the fiscal yea. This comes after real GDP growth recorded 22 percent (y/y) during 2013/1. The main contributors to growth during 2014/15 Q3 were the internal trade, construction, building and the real estate sectors, while the extractions sector remained wea. In the meantime, investment growth more than compensated for the negative contribution of the widening trade defici. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks and uncertainty that surround the global economy on the back of softening growth in emerging markets and challenges facing the Euro Area could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

Ukraine,2015-10-29,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to leave the discount rate unchanged at 22% per annum. NBU Board Resolution No. 750, dated October 29, 2015 On the Money Market Regulation has been issued to this effect. During the deliberation of this issue, the Board members pointed to some recovery in economic activity in September, which was reflected in better industrial and agricultural output figures, as well as higher export revenues. In particular, in September, the decline in the Index of Key Sectors Output moderated to 7.4% yoy compared with 9.7% in August, primarily reflecting better performance of the agricultural and industrial sectors. Implementation of the agreements on cessation of hostilities contributed to the faster growth in the mining industry and the recovery of metallurgy growth. Further stabilization of the financial system is taking hold. Firstly, domestic-currency retail deposits have kept increasing, whereas foreign currency deposits reported growth in September for the first time in the past two years. Second, an excess of foreign exchange supply over demand has enabled the National Bank to accumulate international reserves. There has been progress in anchoring mid-term inflation expectations of market participants. Despite such positive developments, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine took into account ongoing short-term inflation risks when taking a decision to keep the discount rate unchanged. Headline inflation in September 2015 accelerated to 2.3% mom, primarily reflecting lagged effects of Hryvnia devaluation on prices of seasonal goods and further increases in administered prices. In October, inflation figures are expected to be relatively high, primarily reflecting price rises for some foodstuffs due to a lower-than-expected harvest of seasonal crops, as well as increases in heating prices. The decision by the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine to keep the discount rate unchanged aims to further anchor inflation expectations. The fundamental factors underpinning the disinflationary trend remain relevant. These factors include weak domestic demand, low global commodity prices, a balanced current account and sound fiscal policy. In view of the above, the National Bank of Ukraine keeps its inflation projections unchanged at 12% (by the end of 2016). Going forward, as an expected disinflationary trend takes hold, the National Bank of Ukraine will continue monetary policy easing, which was initiated in August 2015. Given a gradual stabilization of the banking system, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine adopted a decision to reduce the amount of cash balances which banks are allowed to include in reserves from 100% to 75%. Today, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has approved a schedule for regular monetary policy decision-making meetings for 2016. It has been published on the NBU's official website, which would enhance the transparency and predictability of monetary policy decisions to the market and the public. The next meeting of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine on monetary policy issues will be held on December 17, 2015 in accordance with the approved schedule."
Colombia,2015-10-30,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp to 5.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into consideration the following aspects. Annual consumer inflation in September stood at 5.35%, and the average of the four measures of core inflation registered 4.89%. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years increased, registering 4.1% and 3.5%, respectively, while those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are above 4.0%. Acceleration of inflation so far this year is mainly explained by the pass-through of nominal depreciation to consumer prices and the increase in the cost of imported raw materials, as well as by the lower dynamics in food supply. Pass-through of part of the devaluation of the peso to consumer prices and a strong presence of El Nino have slowed down convergence of inflation to the target, due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations, as well as to the probable triggering of indexation mechanisms. The technical staff revised upwards its forecast of the most likely figure of growth for the economy in 2015 from 2.8% to 3.0%, within a range between 2.4% and 3.4%. New records of economic activity for the third quarter suggest a greater-than-expected dynamism. On the side of demand, retail sales show that household spending would have been more dynamic, in spite of the decline in the confidence index. Investment expectations show that construction and civil works would continue with good dynamics. On the supply side, the indicators for industry, retail trade and construction have performed better than expected. The increase in inflation expectations has considerably reduced the measures of the real policy interest rate and of the financial system. At the same time, domestic credit growth remains above the expansion of output. Figures for global economic activity continue to reflect a weak dynamics of external demand, below that recorded for 2014. The economy of the United States exhibited moderation in its growth rate, while the euro zone is recovering slowly. China continues slowing down, and the major Latin American economies exhibit low growth rates or output contractions. In the United States, the FED decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate unaltered. As for Latin America, the risk premia of the major economies remain at levels higher than those of 2014. The international prices of oil and other commodities exported by Colombia continue at low levels. The fall in the terms of trade recorded throughout the year has deteriorated national income, largely explaining the higher level of the exchange rate vis--vis the US dollar. In short, inflation expectations have increased and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand, beyond that which is consistent with the decline registered in national income, has moderated. In order to ensure convergence of inflation to the target range, the Board of Directors decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp. The Board reiterates its commitment to the inflation target and continues to carefully monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation, as well as that of asset markets and the international situation. Finally, the Board announced a call options auction mechanism with the purpose of moderating unjustified increases in the exchange rate, which may contribute to unanchor inflation expectations, as well as providing liquidity to the exchange rate market whenever a significant lack of it takes place. The auction will be summoned for USD 500 million once the exchange rate reaches 7 percentage points above its 20 period moving average. Options will be valid for one month from the day of the auction and its exercise is subject to compliance of the aforesaid condition. Bogot."
Russia,2015-10-30,"On 30 October 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 11.0 percent per annum, in recognition of persistent substantial inflation risks. The balance between inflation risks and the risks of economy cooling has mainly remained unchanged. Given the decision made, the moderately tight monetary conditions and the weak domestic demand will keep putting downward pressure on inflation. The annual pace of consumer price growth in October 2016 is estimated to be under 7% and expected to total 4% in 2017. As inflation slows down in line with the forecast, the Bank of Russia will continue with a downward revision of its key rate, at one of its forthcoming Board of Directors meetings. In making its rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will be guided by changes in the balance between inflation risks and the risks of economy cooling. Between September and October, annual inflation was slightly down. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, annual consumer prices grew at 15.6% as of 26 October, and at 15.8% in August. Inflation expectations, though having decreased as compared with September, remain elevated. The moderately tight monetary policy and the weak domestic demand driven by the low growth of the nominal income of the population, help constrain the growth of consumer prices. The moderately tight monetary conditions are also exerting downward pressure on prices. Money supply (M2) growth rates remain low. Influenced by the Bank of Russia's previous key rate reductions, lending and deposit rates remain on a downward trend. These still remain on the level which, on the one hand, serves to keep ruble savings attractive and, on the other hand, given sustaining high debt burden and tight creditworthiness requirements, is a factor behind low annual lending expansion. September saw a somewhat slower economic downturn, evidenced by key macroeconomic indicators. While structural factors are still curbing economic growth, the current output contraction is also of a cyclical nature. However, the negative demographic trends keep unemployment low, while the labour market is adjusting to the new conditions, largely through a decline in real wages and wider part-time employment. These factors, along with low retail lending, will further contain consumer spending. Fixed capital investment will continue to be weak amid persistent economic uncertainty and relatively tough lending conditions. Investment demand is expected to be constrained by limited potential substitution of external finance with domestic one, following the narrow nature of the Russian financial market and high corporate debt load. Investment is likely to be supported somewhat by the governmental turnaround programme. Weak investment and consumer activity will cause low demand for imports. As a result, net exports will be a positive contributor to the annual output growth. Going forward, the economic situation will depend on the global energy prices and the pace of economy's adjustment to external shocks. The slack domestic demand and the moderately tight monetary conditions will drag down annual inflation in 2016-2017. A slowdown in the annual consumer price growth will create prerequisites for decrease in inflation expectations. In early 2016, annual inflation is expected to decline considerably due to, among other factors, its high value in early 2015. The Bank of Russia forecasts the annual consumer price growth to be under 7% in October 2016, on track to reach the 4% target in 2017, facilitated by the current monetary policy. As inflation slows down in line with the forecast, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors will continue with a downward revision of its key rate, at one of its forthcoming meetings. Key sources of inflation risks include a further worsening of external climate, persistently high inflation expectations and an upward revision, planned for 2016-2017, of rates and prices in the regulated sector, upward revision of social payments indexation, as well as overall budget policy easing. In making its subsequent decisions, the Bank of Russia will be guided by changes in the balance between inflation risks and the risks of economy cooling. The Bank of Russia will hold its next rate review meeting on 11 December 2015. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Georgia,2015-11-04,"04.11.15 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 50 Basis Points to 7.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on November 4, 2015 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the National Bank of Georgia continues the monetary policy tightening in response to increased inflation expectations. Further changes in the monetary policy will depend on the inflation forecast, factors affecting it and on general state of the economy. According to the current forecast, in the beginning of 2016 the inflation will remain above its target value, will start decreasing afterwards and will return to its target value of 5% in the second half of 2016. The annual growth in consumer prices equaled 5.8% in October. The main factors causing rise in inflation are still coming from the supply side, namely the increase in the input costs of production due to exchange rate depreciation and higher prices on certain imported goods. An important impact on the inflation came from the one-time increase in the electricity tariff. The rise in inflation has been limited by the weak aggregate demand and decrease in the world prices of oil and food products. The real GDP growth in the second quarter was consistent with the forecasts. According to preliminary forecasts the real growth since the start of the year was 2.7%. The factor hindering the growth is the external sector, which, given the dire economic situation in the region negatively affects the income from export of goods and services. The domestic demand is also weak, as a result of the decline in remittances and increase in the service burden of foreign currency denominated loans due to the changes in the GEL/USD exchange rate. There have been some positive developments in relation to the elimination of external imbalance. Given the decrease in foreign currency inflows the change in the exchange rate has caused import to adjust. Since the beginning of the year the import has decreased by 14 percent (excluding the import of hepatitis C treatment medications). Accordingly we can assume that the impact of the existing external shock on the exchange rate has been exhausted. Other things equal no additional pressure can be expected on the exchange rate coming from the existing external shock. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to prevent the negative expectations that have been on the rise in the recent period from growing into inflationary process. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 15, 2015."
Poland,2015-11-04,"Warsaw, 4 November 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 November 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 0.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 1.75% on an annual basis. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate. In the euro area, economic recovery continues, and incoming data point to stable GDP growth in this economy. In the United States. GDP growth in the third quarter slowed down, however, the recovery is expected to continue in the coming quarters. At the same time, in China economic growth decreased again, while Russia and Brazil remain in recession. Therefore, concerns about the economic growth outlook in the emerging economies persist, which increases uncertainty about economic conditions worldwide. The fall in commodity prices in the recent months has contributed to lower inflation in many economies, including in the United States and the euro area. Against this background, the Federal Reserve and the ECB are keeping interest rates close to zero, although the Federal Reserve indicates the possibility of interest rate hike. On the other hand, the ECB continues its asset purchase programme and has signalled its extension, which has contributed to a decline in risk aversion in the financial markets in the recent period. In Poland stable economic growth continues, driven mainly by domestic demand. The growth in demand is supported by robust labour market, strong consumer confidence, improvement in financial standing of enterprises as well as by stable lending growth. On the other hand, demand in the economy is adversely affected by uncertainty facing firms regarding the outlook for global growth. As demand is growing at a moderate pace and the output gap is still negative, there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Both the annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative. The sharp drop of commodity prices in the global markets remains the main reason for continued deflation. Amidst moderate wage growth, the fall in commodity prices contains the risk of increasing cost pressure. Against this background, inflation expectations are still very low. The Council became acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on NBP 1/2 interest rates. In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 19 October 2015 (projection cut-off date)  there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of -0.9  -0.8% in 2015 (as compared to -1.1  -0.4% in the July 2015 projection), 0.4  1.8% in 2016 (as compared to 0.7  2.5%) and 0.4  2.5% in 2017 (as compared to 0.5  2.6%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth rate  in line with this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 2.9  3.9% in 2015 (as compared to 3.0  4.3% in the July 2015 projection), 2.3  4.3% in 2016 (as compared to 2.3  4.5%) and 2.4  4.6% in 2017 (as compared to 2.5  4.7%). In the opinion of the Council, price growth will slowly increase in the nearest quarters, supported by the gradual closing of the output gap amid improving economic conditions in the euro area and favourable domestic labour market developments. At the same time, the risk of a sharper slowdown in the emerging economies and the impact this may have on global economic activity, as well as the possibility of commodity prices persisting at low levels, and as a result, low inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, remain the source of uncertainty about the pace of inflation returning to the target. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council adopted Inflation Report  November 2015."
Czech Republic,2015-11-05,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. According to the forecast, inflation will increase and hit the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. In 2017, it will be slightly above the target. According to the forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur from early 2017. The Bank Board assesses the risks to the new forecast as balanced. A need to maintain significantly expansionary monetary conditions persists. The likelihood that it will be necessary to discontinue the exchange rate commitment earlier than assumed in the forecast is decreasing over time. In this situation, the Bank Board discussed extending the duration of the exchange rate commitment. It agreed that its discontinuation would probably shift to around the end of 2016. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate at the monetary policy horizon to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to domestic prices and other nominal variables. As regards the assumptions of the forecast regarding the external environment, growth in economic activity in the euro area will accelerate slightly further in the near future and fluctuate around 2% over the entire forecast horizon. Industrial producer prices in the euro area are still falling markedly owing to low energy commodity prices and are not expected to return to year-on-year growth until the second half of next year, i.e. later than assumed in the previous forecast. The currently low consumer price inflation in the euro area will rise gradually owing to rising demand and the unwinding of the effect of the slump in oil prices, but will not exceed 2% before the end of 2017. The subdued inflation is reflected in accommodative ECB monetary policy. This is reflected in the outlook for 3M Euribor rates, which remain close to zero over the entire forecast horizon. The Brent crude oil price has declined recently. According to market outlooks, it should rise slowly. Its outlook has been revised downwards slightly over the entire horizon compared to the previous forecast. Koruna prices of energy will also be affected by the outlook for a gradually weakening exchange rate of the euro against the dollar in 2016. Domestic headline inflation fell in 2015 Q3 as a result of a marked slowdown in annual food price inflation and an acceleration of the decline in fuel prices. The anti-inflationary effect of import prices stemming from the fall in euro area producer prices and global commodity prices will subside gradually, and import prices will be slightly inflationary in the second half of next year. The growing domestic economy will foster higher costs and consequently higher consumer prices over the entire forecast horizon via accelerating wage growth and rising prices of other inputs. This will be reflected in a gradual rise in headline inflation, which will hit the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon and exceed it slightly in 2017. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will follow a similar path to headline inflation. It will be only slightly lower owing to positive contributions from changes to indirect taxes stemming from further increases in excise duty on tobacco products. It, too, will thus be slightly above the 2% target as from the start of 2017. Annual growth in the Czech economy picked up further in 2015 Q2. As a result, economic output approached its potential from below. All expenditure components, in particular fixed investment and household consumption, contributed to the year-on-year growth in GDP. The economy will continue to show robust growth for the rest of this year. Low oil prices, easy domestic monetary conditions and higher government investment will lead to GDP growth of 4.7% this year. Next year, economic growth will slow somewhat to just below 3%. This slowdown will be due to a fall in government investment and the unwinding of the effect of the fall in oil prices. The economy will maintain a similar rate of growth in 2017, with positive contributions from all components of domestic demand. The rising economic activity will manifest itself in continued employment growth, which will result in a further decrease in the number of unemployed persons. In this situation, wage growth in the business sector will increase noticeably and wage growth in the non-business sector will slow somewhat from its current high level. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in interest rates amid gradual appreciation of the koruna in 2017. Compared to the previous forecast, the predictions for headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation are lower until 2016 Q3 owing to lower observed inflation and a lower outlook for foreign producer prices and domestic administered prices. As from the end of 2016, by contrast, the inflation forecast has been revised upwards slightly, reflecting higher domestic economic activity and related stronger upward pressures on costs, especially wages. The inflation outlook is thus slightly higher at the monetary policy horizon compared to the previous forecast. The unexpectedly strong GDP growth so far has led to a marked increase in the GDP growth forecast for this year. However, the economic growth outlook for the next two years is virtually unchanged from the previous forecast. The assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016 remains unchanged in the forecast."
Malaysia,2015-11-05,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. The economic recovery in the major advanced economies has remained modest. While growth has slowed in most of Asia, the region continues to record positive growth that is being supported by domestic demand. Volatility in the international financial markets has receded, but markets will continue to be affected by shifts in global liquidity and investor sentiments. Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high arising from the moderating growth momentum in a number of major economies, uncertainty surrounding energy and commodity prices and possible disorderly market conditions arising from policy shifts in major economies. The performance of the Malaysian economy continues to be affected by the weak external environment. Domestic demand therefore remains the main driver of growth. Private consumption is, however, expected to moderate as households continue adjusting to the higher cost of living amidst an uncertain economic environment. Household spending will nevertheless be supported by wage growth and stable labour market conditions. Despite the slowing investment activity in the oil and gas industry, investment is being supported by infrastructure development projects and capital spending by the manufacturing and services sectors. Looking ahead, domestic demand will continue to be the key driver of growth, with an additional lift from exports as global growth improves. The Malaysian economy will continue to benefit from having diversified sources of growth, economic flexibility, low unemployment, manageable level of external debt and a well-capitalised banking system. The prospects are for the economy to expand within the region of 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year and 4 to 5 percent in 2016. It is, however, recognised that the downside risks to growth remain high. Headline inflation averaged at 2.8% in August and September, and is expected to remain relatively stable for the rest of 2015. Despite the weaker ringgit exchange rate, the impact on overall inflation has been limited by the lower commodity prices and the generally low global inflation. For 2016, headline inflation is expected to be higher, to peak in the first quarter and moderating thereafter. Global and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets. In this environment, however, domestic liquidity continues to be sufficient and the financial system remains sound with healthy growth in financing. Financial intermediation has therefore continued to support the economy. Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to ensure the orderly functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are heightened risks in the global economic and financial environment. These risks are being carefully monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2016. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 6 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2016. 20 and 21 January 2016 (Wednesday and Thursday). 8 and 9 March 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 18 and 19 May 2016 (Wednesday and Thursday). 12 and 13 July 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 6 and 7 September 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 22 and 23 November 2016 (Tuesday and Wednesday).

Romania,2015-11-05,"Video (Romanian only): Press briefing, 5 November 2015 Press conference, 9 November 2015 - quarterly inflation report. The NBR Board has examined and approved the Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for 9 November 2015. The latest statistical data point to the annual inflation rate remaining in negative territory. It followed however a path below the projected one, due chiefly to a larger-than-expected drop in fuel prices. In September 2015, the annual inflation rate stood at -1.7 percent, as a combined effect of lower volatile prices and the broadening of the scope of the 9 percent reduced VAT rate to all food items, non-alcoholic beverages and public food services as of 1 June 2015. The average annual inflation rate fell to zero, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, went down to 0.2 percent, from 0.5 percent in August 2015. Turning to economic activity, the relative slowdown in second-quarter growth was not attributable to the main aggregate demand components, as private consumption and investment made the largest contributions to real GDP growth in the post-crisis period, while net external demand had a smaller negative contribution. Statistical data also illustrate that the dynamics of nominal wage earnings and unit labour costs in the industrial sector stayed on an upward trend. The assessment of monetary indicators reveals a consolidation of the annual growth in credit to the private sector, solely on the back of a faster pick-up in leu-denominated loans. Their share in the loan stock reached 50.2 percent, outstripping, for the first time in about eight years, the share of forex loans. This is beneficial for the monetary policy transmission mechanism and for mitigating risks to financial stability. The general context rendered the adoption of a monetary policy decision more difficult. Domestically, the process to appoint a new cabinet fuels the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic policy mix, especially as the drafting of the 2016 budget is still pending. The external environment also remains fraught with uncertainties, stemming mostly from the economic developments in China and other major emerging economies, with an impact on economic growth in the euro area and elsewhere. Adding to this are the further diverging monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks. Under the circumstances and based on the currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report. The new forecast reconfirms the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain in negative territory over the next three quarters and then to return to positive values, which will stand below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target until the beginning of 2017. The NBR Board is restating that its decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term, while safeguarding financial stability. Furthermore, the NBR Board considers that a balanced economic policy mix and the progress in structural reforms are pivotal to preserving macrostability, ensuring lasting economic growth, carrying on convergence with the European Union, as well as enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to potential shocks or adverse conditions worldwide. The NBR reiterates that the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools, amid close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, will ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 November 2015. In line with the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 7 January 2016."
Armenia,2015-11-08,"PRESS RELEASE 11.08.2015 At the meeting dated August 11, 2015, the Board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia decided to reduce the Refinancing Rate by 0.25 pp and set it at 10.25%. There was 2.2% of deflation in July of 2015 compared with 0.9% of deflation recorded in the same month last year, and the 12-month inflation rate decreased to reach 4.2% late in the month. Actual developments show that slower-than-expected global economic growth persisted in the external sector. Under this circumstance, world commodity markets further saw deflationary patterns. Based on these developments, as well as in anticipation of weak global demand and excess supply in certain commodity markets in the upcoming months, the Board of the Central Bank admits that inflationary effects from the external sector are not likely. The Board of the Central Bank states that growth rates of economic activity exceeded the expectations during the second quarter of 2015. In the period January-June 2015, relative to the same reference period last year, the economic activity indicator has amounted to 4.2%. This was attributable to higher growth rates recorded in agriculture in the first place and industry in part. Notwithstanding high growth rates in export of agricultural product and that these trends would be persisting in the near future, positive developments in the agricultural sector will lead to lower prices of agricultural products in comparison with the same period last year. The shaped low inflationary environment will be in part offset by more stimulating fiscal policy implementation. At the same time, the inflationary effect that was formerly expected to come from electricity price increase since August 1, 2015 now is out of consideration. In the light of these developments, the Board estimates, the 12-month inflation rate will reduce and stay within the lower bound of the confidence band over the second half of the year. This can be a reason for the Central Bank to consider loosening the monetary conditions. Yet, risks in the external sector and domestic economy are persisting. If such risks materialize, the inflation environment may expand. This may, in turn, prompt the Central Bank to adjust the directions of monetary policy appropriately, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium-term perspective. Detailed information on the setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program, 3rd quarter 2015) due on August 21, 2015. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Armenia,2015-11-10,"PRESS RELEASE 10 November 2015 At the November 10, 2015 Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to lower the refinancing rate by 0.5 pp to 9.75%. Deflation was 0.4% in October 2015, compared to 1.0% inflation to the same reference month last year. As a result, 12-month inflation continued to fall, reaching 1.9% at the end of October 2015. As to the external sector, growth of the global economy remained slow, while prices in the international commodity markets continued to decline. The Central Bank Board believes that these trends will continue in the upcoming months, due to which the external sector is expected to have a deflationary impact on domestic prices. The Board notes that the 2015 January-September economic activity compared to the same period of 2014 was 3.7%, which was mostly driven by growth in agriculture and mining. Under these circumstances, the decline in inflation was almost fully due to agricultural products prices being lower than in the same period of 2014. Domestic demand remains weak, despite the expansionary impact of fiscal policy in 2015. The Central Bank Board estimates that persisting weak domestic demand and the deflationary external environment are slowly reflected in the inflation indicator net of agricultural products, which points to still high inflationary expectations. Nonetheless, the Central Bank Board believes that, as inflation expectations subside, inflation of these products will decline, as well. Under these conditions, the Central Bank Board considers it appropriate to ease the monetary conditions, which could have been sharper under expectations of low inflation. The Central Bank Board estimates that low inflation will persist in the upcoming months, but will expand slowly as a result of the outlined policies and stabilize around the target in the forecast horizon. Subject to anchoring of inflationary expectations and the absence of additional domestic and external risks, the Central Bank Board will continue to ease the monetary conditions. Detailed information underlying the determination of the interest rate level can be found in the Inflation Report to be published on 20 November (Q4 2015 Monetary Policy Program).

Philippines,2015-11-11,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of inflation dynamics and the risks to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon. Latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that inflation could settle below the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2015. However, notwithstanding the recent low inflation readings, inflation is projected to return steadily to a path consistent with the inflation target for 2016-2017, given the foreseen adverse weather conditions and the pending petitions for utility rate increases. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target band. The Monetary Board also considered the risks to the inflation outlook to be broadly balanced. On the one hand, potential upside pressures could come from the impact of protracted El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates. On the other hand, downside risks could arise from possible slower-than-expected global economic activity. The Monetary Board also observed that domestic demand conditions have stayed firm, as business and consumer sentiment continue to be buoyant and domestic liquidity remains adequate. In addition, the Monetary Board noted that the challenging external environment and uneven growth prospects in advanced and key emerging economies supported a steady policy setting. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that the benign inflation environment and the economy's underlying growth momentum provide adequate room to maintain monetary policy settings. The BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure price and financial stability conducive to sustainable economic growth."
Chile,2015-11-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 November 2015 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25%. Internationally, recent information confirms stronger growth in developed economies and less dynamic emerging markets. Available information on the United States reveals a higher probability of the first policy rate increase by the Federal Reserve occurring in December. As anticipated as this event has been, risks of possible disruptions in the markets persist. In general, commodity prices declined during the month. On the domestic front. October's CPI inflation was somewhat higher than expected, with a surprise centered on core inflation (CPIEFE). Annual CPI and CPIEFE inflation was 4% and 4.8%, respectively. Inflation expectations two years ahead remain at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Third-quarter indicators showed that output and demand evolved in line with forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. Confidence indicators posted a marginal increase, but remain in pessimistic territory. Private job creation and wage growth remain dynamic. The future path of the monetary policy rate considers additional adjustments aimed to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2015-11-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the modest improvements in the euro area have continued. Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility due for example to a shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, although domestic demand activities such as consumption and investment have sustained their paces of recovery, while economic agents' sentiments have improved somewhat, the trend of declining exports has persisted. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has increased steadily, and in October the unemployment rate fell compared to that in October of last year while the employment-to-population ratio maintained the same level. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation rose from 0.6% the month before to 0.9% in October, due mainly to expansions in the extents of increase in agricultural product prices and in service fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose to 2.3%, from 2.1% in September. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have persisted in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices, after having risen in line mostly with increases in stock prices in major countries and with net inflows of securities investment funds of foreigners, have fallen back as the likelihood of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve has grown. After having appreciated, the Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Long-term market interest rates have risen, in response mainly to increases in interest rates in major countries and the improvements in domestic economic indicators. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt and external risk factors such as any changes in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy or in economic conditions in emerging market countries including China, as well as the trends of capital flows."
Peru,2015-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2015 BCRP MAINTAINS THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.50 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will converge to the target range in 2016 and takes into account that: Inflation expectations are gradually converging towards the target range. Inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors such as the rise in the prices of some food products and by the depreciation of the nuevo sol against the dollar, the effect of these factors not being foreseen to extend in a general manner to the rest of prices. International indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets. Economic activity has been recovering gradually. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and stands ready to make adjustments in its monetary policy rate to lead inflation to the target range in the policy horizon, should it be necessary. Inflation in October recorded a rate of 0.14 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation decreased from 3.90 in September to 3.66 percent in October. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of perishable food products and meals outside the home. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.14 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation registered 3.46 percent in October, a similar rate to that observed in the previous month. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations show an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels, but with a faster pace of growth in the second half of the year. It is estimated that the economy will be growing at rates similar to those of the potential output in 2016. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.25 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Monetary Program for the following month will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on December 10, 2015."
Hungary,2015-11-17,"At its meeting on 17 November 2015, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 1.35%. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth continues. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy, and therefore the domestic real economic environment continues to have a disinflationary impact. Inflation remains substantially below the Bank's target. The annual consumer price index and core inflation both rose in October. As a result, inflation returned into positive territory. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy. Core inflation is likely to rise gradually as a result of an expansion in domestic demand and rises in wages, but the persistently low cost environment contains the increase in the consumer price index. The stabilisation of inflation expectations around the target is likely to contribute to price and wage-setting being consistent with the inflation target over the medium term as the output gap closes. Inflation is expected to remain substantially below the 3 per cent target over the coming months, and is only likely to rise to levels around 3 per cent at the end of the forecast horizon. Based on preliminary GDP data. Hungarian economic growth continued in the third quarter of 2015, at a lower rate than expected. Due to a slowdown in external demand, industrial production weakened slightly in the third quarter relative to the previous period, which may have contributed to the slowdown in economic growth. The dynamics of retail sales have been stable in recent months, with their volume increasing across a wide range of products. Employment rose further while the unemployment rate fell. Domestic demand is making an increasing contribution to economic growth. Government investment is likely to fall as funding from the EU declines considerably, the impact of which is expected to be offset by the gradual pick-up in private sector investment and the Bank's Growth Supporting Programme. The latter also helps to restore market-based financing and achieve a lasting turnaround in lending over the longer term. Overall, sentiment in global financial markets has been mixed over the period since the Council's latest policy decision. During the period, the main factors affecting global appetite for risk were the ECB's communication suggesting that it would adopt a looser monetary policy stance looking forward, continued uncertainty about the interest rate increase by the Fed, and concerns over growth prospects in emerging economies. Conditions in Hungarian financial markets were characterised by increased volatility, with the forint depreciating slightly against the euro. The domestic CDS spread and long-term government bond yields have been broadly unchanged since the previous policy decision. Market yield expectations moved in line with the Bank's guidance that the central bank base rate would be held constant over an extended period. The targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank also facilitate a decline in long-term yields and, consequently, a loosening of monetary conditions. Forward-looking money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are likely to decline even further as inflation rises. Hungary's persistently strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. In the Council's assessment, a cautious approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate, while the negative output gap is expected to close only gradually over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period, over the entire forecast horizon, are consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy."
South Africa,2015-11-19,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 19 November 2015 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the inflation forecast has remained relatively unchanged but the risks to the forecast have increased. The key risks are a marked depreciation of the rand; worsening drought conditions and their likely impact on food prices; and the possibility of additional electricity tariff adjustments. At the same time the economy remains weak despite an improved performance in the manufacturing sector, but both the mining and agricultural sectors appear to have contracted further in the third quarter. Although global financial markets have stabilised somewhat since the previous meeting, the outlook for emerging markets in particular remains challenging. The US Fed is likely to raise its policy rate in December, and further volatility in financial markets can be expected in the lead-up to this. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4,7 per cent in October, following two consecutive months at 4,6 per cent. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation surprised again on the MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 1. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation surprised again on the MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 1 downside at 4,8 per cent, with a contribution of 0,7 percentage points to the overall CPI outcome. Services price inflation remained unchanged at 5,6 per cent, while goods price inflation increased to 3,7 per cent from 3,6 per cent previously. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5,2 per cent, down from 5,3 per cent in the previous two months. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased from 3,4 per cent in August to 3,6 per cent in September. The main pressure came from the category of food, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 2,0 percentage points to the outcome. Food and agricultural crop price developments are expected to sustain the upward trend in PPI in the coming months. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a slight near-term improvement, while the medium-term forecast is marginally higher. Inflation is now expected to average 4,6 per cent in 2015, and 6,0 per cent and 5,8 per cent in the next two years. The anticipated breach of the upper end of the target range in the first quarter of 2016 is now expected to average 6,4 per cent, compared with 6,7 per cent previously. The trajectory for the rest of the year is also slightly lower than previously forecast, with the temporary breach in the fourth quarter of 6,1 per cent. The forecast for 2017 follows a slow downward trend, with inflation still expected to measure 5,7 per cent in the final quarter. The changes in the forecast are due to a lower starting point for the forecast, lower international oil price assumptions, and an adjustment to fees for higher education which are more or less offset by a more depreciated starting point for the real effective exchange rate. MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 2. MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 2 The forecast for core inflation is marginally higher, with an expected average of 5,5 per cent in 2016, and 5,4 per cent in 2017, mainly due to the more depreciated exchange rate assumption. The BER inflation expectations survey is only due for release in December. The median inflation forecast of analysts polled in the latest Reuters Econometer survey is similar to that of the Bank, and also declined marginally since the previous survey. The breakeven inflation rates, while having improved since the previous meeting, remain above the upper end of the target range. Divergent global developments continue to create a challenging environment for monetary policy. Although the US recovery appears to be sustained with further improvements in the labour market, the strong dollar poses downside risks to both growth and inflation. The UK economy also remains on its recovery path. By contrast, the recovery in the euro area is much weaker, although the outlook is more favourable than it was earlier in the year. The Japanese economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, with positive, but slow growth expected in the coming quarters. The Chinese economy shows signs of stabilising, aided by policy stimulus, but the medium-term outlook remains a concern. There is still some uncertainty regarding the extent to which services output and consumption has compensated for the decline in industrial output and investment. A tail-risk of a hard landing remains, which would have a significant impact on countries with direct trade linkages, particularly those in Asia, as well as on commodity prices. Russia and Brazil remain in recession, while the strong performance of the Indian economy has been sustained following a number of structural reforms. The outlook MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 3. The outlook MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 3 for sub-Saharan Africa, while still positive, has deteriorated in the wake of lower commodity prices, and further weakening could create greater headwinds for South African manufactured exports to this region. Global inflation trends are also benign, with concerns about deflation abating in most advanced economies. Despite significant currency depreciations in commodity- producing economies in particular, inflation pressures have generally been surprisingly contained, with a few exceptions. Emerging markets have had differing experiences: a number of countries in Latin America, particularly commodity producers, have tightened policy in recent months in response to incipient inflationary pressures, while others with low inflation, particularly in Asia, have loosened policy further. In the advanced economies, monetary policy divergence is expected to continue. Monetary policy is set to remain accommodative in the euro area and Japan, with possible further quantitative easing, against a backdrop of slow growth and benign inflation pressures. In the US, inflation and labour market dynamics, as well as Fed communication, suggest that in the absence of any major surprises or shocks, an increase in the policy rate can be expected in December. Market expectations are for monetary policy tightening in the UK to commence sometime in the second half of 2016, later than previously expected. Although volatility in global asset markets has moderated amid improving risk sentiment, emerging market foreign exchange markets have been relatively volatile and vulnerable to capital outflows. In the past three months South Africa has also seen net portfolio outflows: since the end of August, according to the JSE data, non- MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 4. In the past three months South Africa has also seen net portfolio outflows: since the end of August, according to the JSE data, non- MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 4 resident sales of equities amounted to R25,9 billion, while net bond sales amounted to R5,9 billion. The rand exchange rate has been particularly volatile, even compared to its peers, as domestic factors also impacted on the currency. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by about 1,0 per cent against the euro but has depreciated by around 3,0 per cent against the dollar, and by 1,5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. As before, the extent to which Fed tightening has been priced into the exchange rate remains uncertain. Nevertheless, a high degree of volatility and overshooting of the exchange rate may be expected in the lead-up to, and in the immediate aftermath of the start of the US interest rate cycle. Fed communication of future moves will be key. To date, the indications are that a moderate policy hiking cycle will be pursued. The domestic economic growth prospects remain subdued amid weak business confidence, but a further contraction in the third quarter is not expected. The Bank's forecast for GDP growth has been revised down marginally for 2015 and 2016 to 1,4 per cent and 1,5 per cent, but remains unchanged at 2,1 per cent for 2017. The estimate of short-term potential output remains unchanged at 1,8 per cent for this year, rising to 2,1 per cent in 2017. The Bank's composite leading business cycle indicator declined further in August, consistent with the fragile outlook. The manufacturing sector recovered somewhat in the third quarter, mainly due to a surprisingly strong performance in September, and is expected to have contributed positively to GDP growth. However, the Barclays PMI declined further in October, and has been below the neutral level of 50 for three consecutive months, suggesting a constrained outlook for the sector. The mining sector is expected to subtract from MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 5. The mining sector is expected to subtract from MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 5 GDP growth following a further contraction in the third quarter, while the continuing drought points to a third successive quarterly contraction for the agricultural sector. The outlook for the construction sector is constrained following significant declines in new building plans passed, and reflected in a 9 point drop in the FNB/BER Building Confidence Index. Against this backdrop, formal sector employment trends remain disappointing. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa, employment in the formal non-agricultural sector declined in the second quarter of 2015, as the private sector continued to shed jobs. Although the Quarterly Labour Force Survey indicates an increase in the number of persons employed in the third quarter, the number of unemployed persons rose sharply in the quarter as the number of new entrants increased. Consequently, the official unemployment rate increased to 25,5 per cent in the third quarter. There are minimal demand side pressures in the economy, with consumption expenditure by households continuing to be inhibited inter alia by low consumer confidence, declining disposable income growth and slow employment growth. The latest retail trade sales data suggest that household expenditure may have lost further momentum in the third quarter. Durable goods sales remain under pressure, as indicated in the intensification of the downward trend in motor vehicle sales in recent months. Consumption expenditure is also constrained by the continued slow growth in credit extension to households by banks. Unsecured lending remains subdued, and is likely to be impacted further by the recently announced caps on interest rates by the DTI, while the decline in growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance is MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 6. Unsecured lending remains subdued, and is likely to be impacted further by the recently announced caps on interest rates by the DTI, while the decline in growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance is MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 6 indicative of the softer motor vehicle sales. Credit extension to corporates remains robust, particularly commercial mortgage finance, which reflects in part a switch away from funding in the bond market by property funds. The recent Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement signalled a continued commitment to fiscal consolidation by government, although at a slower pace. Most of the expanded deficit is attributable to lower expected tax revenues in response to the weaker growth outlook. Trends in wage growth remain a concern, and contribute to the persistence of inflation at elevated levels. Year-on-year growth in salaries and wages per worker accelerated to 8,7 per cent in second quarter of 2015, and after adjusting for labour productivity increases, total unit labour costs increased from 4,3 per cent to 5,1 per cent. By contrast, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements recorded by Andrew Levy Employment Publications recorded a moderation to 7,7 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 8,1 per cent in 2014. Apart from the exchange rate, the main upside risks to inflation come from possible electricity tariff and food price increases. Eskom's Regulatory Clearing Account (RCA) application to Nersa to claw back excess expenditure of R22,8 billion is likely to lead to a further tariff increase, although the quantum and timing is uncertain. This is in addition to the 12,2 per cent tariff increase already built into the inflation forecast for next year. No provision is made for the RCA application in the forecast at this stage, but it is regarded as an upside risk. A higher food price trajectory has been incorporated in the forecast for some time, but food price inflation has surprised on the downside in recent months, despite MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 7. A higher food price trajectory has been incorporated in the forecast for some time, but food price inflation has surprised on the downside in recent months, despite MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 7 sharp increases in maize and cereals prices earlier in the year. However, the increased intensity of the drought which has led to downward revisions of the domestic maize crop estimate, as well as incipient pressures evident in both the PPI and CPI, suggest that an acceleration in food price inflation is likely, adding to the upside risk to the inflation outlook. By contrast, international oil price developments are expected to remain benign with current spot prices below US$45 per barrel, somewhat lower than those assumed over the forecast period. Although petrol prices have contributed to a succession of downside inflation surprises in recent months, the beneficial impact of lower international oil prices on domestic petrol prices has been offset to some extent by the depreciation of the rand. The latest data suggest that, should current trends continue, a small drop in the petrol price can be expected next month despite the further depreciation of the rand. Although the inflation forecast is relatively unchanged since the previous meeting, the upside risks to the inflation outlook are more pronounced. As noted, these risks relate to the persistent exchange rate depreciation, electricity tariffs and food prices, and are assessed to outweigh possible downside risks from lower international oil prices and subdued exchange rate pass-through. While these factors cannot be dealt with directly through monetary policy, the concern of the Committee is that failure to act could cause inflation expectations to become unanchored and generate second-round effects and more generalised inflation. Although core inflation has remained steady and inflation expectations to date have been relatively anchored, they remain at uncomfortably elevated levels. MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 8. MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 8 The general approach of the MPC is to attempt to see through exogenous shocks and react to second-round effects. However, shocks of a persistent nature, for example extended periods of currency depreciation or drought, or multi-year increases in electricity prices make it more difficult to disentangle these first and second round effects. In the absence of demand pressures, the MPC had to decide whether to act now or later. On the one hand, given the relative stability in the underlying of core inflation, delaying the adjustment could give the MPC room to re-assess these unfolding developments at the next meeting, and avoid possible additional headwinds to the weak growth outlook. On the other hand, delaying the adjustment further could lead to second-round effects and require an even stronger monetary policy response in the future, with more severe consequences for short-term growth. Complicating the decision was the deteriorating economic growth outlook. Although the change to the growth forecast was marginal, the risks to the outlook, which were more or less balanced at the previous meeting, are now assessed to be on the downside. Against this difficult backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6,25 per cent per annum effective from 20 November 2015. Four members preferred an increase, while two members favoured an unchanged stance. Despite the increase, the MPC still views the monetary policy stance to be accommodative. The continuing challenge is for monetary policy to achieve a fine balance between achieving our core mandate of price stability and not undermining short-term growth unduly. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation within the target range while remaining sensitive, to the extent MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 9. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation within the target range while remaining sensitive, to the extent MPC Statement November 19th, 2015 Page 9 possible, to the fragile state of the economy. As before, any future moves will therefore be highly data dependent. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 Candice.

Pakistan,2015-11-21,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Decision November 21, 2015 The average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation at. percent is lower than the. percent average inflation in the corresponding period of last year. The decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core inflation measures came down in this period. Going forward, with subdued outlook of international oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food items, even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of percent, the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum. Moreover market surveys indicate marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months. Current account deficit, despite year on year 10. percent contraction in exports, has narrowed down to USD532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from USD1. billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments, healthy workers' remittances, and the realization of Coalition Support Fund. At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows, surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul-Oct FY16. Going forward, continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position. Furthermore realization of investment inflows stemming from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term. Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM), mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers, and cement production, increased to. percent in Jul-Sep 2015 compared to. percent in the same period of last year. Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing, strong construction activities as per planned development spending, increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes, and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports. Credit to private sector witnessed nominal increase in July-October 2015; wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2-FY15 to Q1-FY16. As result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans, at. percent and. percent in September 2015, are the lowest in 10 years. Thus with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth, borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase. This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward, which during July 01-November 06 2015 M2 has expanded by. percent against. percent during the same period last year. While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs78 billion. Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion. In view of the foregoing, the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at. percent. Page."
Israel,2015-11-23,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index for October increased by 0.1 percent,while forecasters had projected a decline of 0.1 percent, on average. There was a marked increase in the fruit and vegetables component (5 percent), and a seasonal increase in the clothing and footwear component (3.2 percent), while there were declines of 1 percent in transport and communications and of 0.8 percent in home maintenance. An estimate at the Bank of Israel indicates that excluding the reductions in the VAT rate and in electricity rates, the October CPI would have increased by 0.4 percent. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.7 percent, compared with an inflation rate of negative 0.5 percent over the 12 months that ended in September. Prices of CPI components representing tradable goods declined by a record 3.1 percent over the past 12 months, while CPI components representing nontradable items increased by 0.6 percent. The CPI excluding energy components and administrative price declines (such as the reductions in water and electricity rates) increased by 0.9 percent over the past 12 months. The VAT reduction and the decline in fuel prices at filling stations are expected to contribute to a decline in the CPI in November. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:Short-term inflation expectations remained low this month: Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.7 percent, and 1-year expectations derived from the capital market and from banks' internal interest rates are for an inflation rate of 0.3 percent. Two-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market are 0.7 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) forward expectations declined to 1.6 percent, while forward expectations for longer terms (5-10 years) continued to maintain stability, ranging around the midpoint of the inflation target. The Telbor curvedoes not indicate a significant probability of a change in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next year. Private forecasters expect the Bank of Israel interest rate to remain at its current level in the next few months,and to increase in about a year. Real economic activity: The first estimate of third-quarter National Accounts data indicate that GDP grew by 2.5 percent (seasonally adjusted data in annual terms), and business sector product grew by 2.7 percent. These data indicate a return to the growth rate of the past two years, with no compensation in the third quarter for the near-zero growth in the second quarter. Following two quarters of contraction, exports (goods and services, excluding diamonds and startups) increased by 9.7 percent. Private nondurable-goods consumption continued to grow at an adequate rate (6.4 percent), while durable-goods consumption contracted by 16.5 percent, and the increase in investment (in fixed assets, excluding ships and aircraft) remained low, at 0.9 percent. Thus far, it seems that the effect of the wave of violence on economic activity is only moderate: The number of tourist arrivals in October was 5 percent lower than the seasonally adjusted average over the first nine months of the year. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalimdeclined moderately in October, while there was a relatively sharp declinein the index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Foreign trade data indicate a slight decline of 0.2 percent in goods exports in October, following a relatively sharp decline in September. There was an increase of 8.5 percent in goods imports in October, but over time, a standstill is apparent in imports of raw materials and capital goods. The Composite State ofthe Economy Index increased by 0.3 percent in October, led by imports of consumer goods and of manufacturing inputs. The Purchasing Managers Index increased to 51.4 points in October. The Climate Index based on the Business Tendency Survey conducted in October by the Central Bureau of Statistics indicates a decline in the monthly growth rate to 0.21 percent, after having stabilized around 0.23-0.26 percent since the second quarter of 2015. The labor market: The Labor Force Survey for the third quarter continues to indicate a low unemployment rate (4.5 percent among the prime working ages (25-64)), and high employment (76.4 percent) and participation (80.0 percent) rates. A similar picture was presented by survey data for October. The number of employee posts increased by 0.4 percent in August over July,and by 2.7 percent compared to August 2014. However, over time, there appears to be a standstill in the number of employee posts in manufacturing. InJune-August, nominal and real wages increased by 0.4 percent compared with March-May (seasonally adjusted data), and nominal wages increased by 3 percent compared with the corresponding period of the previousyear. Health tax receipts for August-October were approximately 4 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. The job vacancy rate declined slightly in October, to 3.2 percent. Budget data: In January-October, the domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 3.8 billion. Total tax revenues sincethe beginning of the year are about NIS 4.3 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the tax revenue forecast, and about 7.5 percent higher than the same period last year. Gross domestic VAT revenues increased by about 9 percent in real terms since the beginning of the year, compared with the corresponding period in 2014. Domestic government expenditure sincethe beginning of the year is about 5.6 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. The budget for 2015 and 2016 wasapproved in the Knesset, and the deficit ceiling was raised to 2.9 percentof GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on October 25, 2015, through November 20, 2015, the shekel was virtually unchanged against the dollar, and strengthened by about 3.7 percent against the euro. The shekel strengthened by about 1.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on October 25, 2015, through November 20, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 0.4 percent. Yields in the government bond market increased for nearly all terms to maturity. Nominal yields increased by up to 25 basis points for short-medium terms, with a flattening of the curve, while yields on the CPI-indexed curve increased by up to 17 basis points along the entire curve. The makamyield curve traded slightly above the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, asmeasured by the five-year CDS spread, increased from 72 basis points to 80 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in October, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 45.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 14.7 percent. The credit market: In October, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 3.3 billion, higher than the average over the past 12 months (about NIS 2.1 billion). There were particularly high issuances by companies in the investments sector and in the trade and services industry. Corporatebond market spreads were stable, and withdrawals from mutual funds continued. The volume of new mortgages taken out in October was NIS 4.6 billion: an increase compared with September. However, activity in the market in those two months was relatively low due to the holidays. In October, mortgage interest rates continued to increase, by 0.13 percentage points on the CPI-indexed fixed rate track, and by 0.07 percentage points on the CPI-indexed variable rate track. Interest rates remained unchanged on the fixed and variable rate unindexed tracks. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.4 percent in October, and it has increased by 2.0 percentover the past 12 months: lower than the average for that range overthe past three years. In August-September, home prices declined by 0.1 percent, and in the 12 months ending in September, they increased by 6.6 percent. Preliminary data for September indicate a sharp decline in the number of transactions, among investors, first-time home buyers, and buyersupgrading their dwellings. With that, the decline in the volume of transactions derives from strong seasonality in September and from the continued effect on investors of the purchase tax increase in June. The volume of new homes sold in September (seasonally adjusted) remained virtually unchanged compared with the previous month. The stock of homes for sale remained stable in September, at approximately 27,000 homes, about 60 percent of which are by private initiative and about two-thirds of which are in the Tel Aviv,Gush Dan and Jerusalem regions. The high rate of building starts in the past year is expected to continue being reflected in the high level of building completions in the coming period. The global economy: This month, the OECD again reduced its global growth forecast, against the background of weakness in world trade and the slowdown in developing economies. The US economy grew by only 1.5 percent in the third quarter (annual terms), but is expected to grow at a more rapid rate in thefollowing quarter. The employment report for October was surprisingly strong, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by about 270,000 and the unemployment rate declining to 5 percent, as data from various sources indicated increases in wages. The publication of the report, together with various indicators provided by the US Federal Reserve, led to a sharp increase in the probability reflected in the markets that an initial increase in the federal funds rate will occur in December. However, the subsequent path of the increasein the federal funds rate is expected to be moderate. In the eurozone, third quarter growth is estimated at 0.3 percent (quarterly terms), and reflects an acceleration in France and some slowdown in Germany and most other countries. Unemployment continues to decline, and reached 10.8 percent. Although the rate of inflation increased, it remains far from the target, and the ECB signaled that it is possible it will take additional accommodative steps: capital markets ascribe a high probability to the option that the interest rate in the eurozone will be reduced. In Japan, growth has beennegative for two consecutive quarters, despite expansionary policy by the government and central bank. The Bank of Japan pushed off the expected datefor achieving the inflation target and reduced the growth forecast, so that chances increased that additional accommodative steps will be taken. Datain China indicated stability, and concern of a sharp deterioration lessened. In other emerging markets as well there were generally signs of calming,but many are exposed to risks as a result of the decline in demand in China and the expected federal funds rate increase in the US. Commodity prices resumed a decline this month, and the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil fell to $44, compared with $48 the previous month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for December 2015 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. In view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, the Monetary Committee assesses that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The inflation environment in the short term is affected by factors of a one-off nature. Short-terminflation expectations remained low this month, and are affected by these factors and by the recent renewed decline in commodity prices. Medium-term (forward) expectations declined slightly after increasing in the previous month, and long-term (forward) expectations remained entrenched near the midpoint of the target range. C 2B 7 The first estimate of third quarter growth data indicates a return to the rate of growth that prevailed in the past two years, without compensation for the near-zero growth in the second quarter. The rate of growth in nondurable goods consumption was maintained, there was an acceleration in public consumption, and after aprolonged period of time there was a recovery in exports. However, the most recent data indicate that the improvement in exports may have been transitory. The picture presented by labor market data continues to be positive. To date, the effect of the wave of violence on economic activity is moderate. C 2B 7 This month, the OECD again reduced its global growth forecast, against the background of the weakness in world trade and the slowdown in developing economies. Global financial market expectations are that the US Federal Reserve will begin to increase the federal funds rate soon, but that in Europe and other major economies, monetary accommodation will be enhanced. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on October 25, 2015, through November 20, 2015, the shekel strengthened by about 1.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, as the shekel was stable against the dollar and appreciated relativelysharply against the euro. Since the beginning of the year there has been an effective appreciation of 7.5 percent. The development of the exchange rate since the beginning of year is weighing on growth of exports and the tradable sector, and is delaying the return of inflation to within the target range. C 2B 7 The volume of new mortgages taken out remains elevated, as do new home sales and the stock of homes available for sale. Home prices have increased by 6.6 percent over the past 12 months. However, prices have been stable over the past two months. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks toachieving the inflation target and to growth remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it andwill examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for December 2015 will be published on December 7, 2015. The decision regarding the interest rate for January 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. December 28, 2015."
Nigeria,2015-11-23,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique' No. 104 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. November 23 and 24, 2015 rd th The Monetary Policy Committee met on 23 and 24 November, 2015 against the backdrop of slowing global growth and a weakening domestic economic environment, attributable largely to the down turn in oil prices. In attendance were 10 out of 12 members. The Committee appraised the global and domestic economic and financial environments up to October 2015 as well as the economic outlook for the first half of 2016. International Economic Developments The Committee noted the moderation in global output recovery evidenced by the less-than-expected growth of 29 per cent in the first half of 2015. The development 1 was underpinned largely by deteriorating global trade, reversal in output growth in the advanced economies and a significant slowdown in growth in the emerging and developing economies. The key drag on growth in the advanced economies included unfavorable labor market conditions, suppressed foreign demand and weaker than anticipated domestic aggregate demand. Consequently growth in the US. slowed to 15 per cent in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of a drawdown in inventories; deceleration in exports; drag in private consumption, government spending and residential fixed investment. The outlook for the fourth quarter, however, remains optimistic as consumption spending is expected to drive growth, supported by low inflation. The Bank of Japan continued with monetary easing, through its asset purchase program, with a monthly 2 injection of ¥67 trillion ($5427 billion); but this was insufficient to restart output as third quarter growth is projected to be weaker than the second quarter, thereby increasing the likelihood of dampening growth and pressure for higher stimulus. The European Central Bank (ECB) in October 2015; reaffirmed its commitment to its monthly asset purchase of €60 billion ($642 billion) until September, 2016; although the package may fall short of what is required for meaningful impact on growth. Similarly the Bank of England continued its ₤375 billion ($570 billion) monthly asset purchase program, as the economy is expected to retreat from its performance of 07 per cent in the second quarter to about 05 per cent in Q3 with the decline in foreign demand, potentially dampening the prospects for an interest rate hike. Growth in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) continued to sag; reflecting the 3 protracted slowdown in China as well as recession in Russia and Brazil. The slowdown among EMDEs has been mainly due to weak import growth in China, low commodity prices, capital flow reversals, rising debt levels and other geopolitical factors. In effect, the poor growth expectations could continue into the fourth quarter with the likelihood of further dampening into 2016. Overall monetary policy in the most advanced and emerging market economies appears oriented towards easing to revive output and strengthen employment. No substantial upswing is expected around the current tepid global inflation, projected to remain moderate through 2016. The continuously bearish commodity prices and stronger consumer sentiments have dampened consumer prices in the advanced economies. In the 4 emerging and developing markets, the major risk to domestic prices is mainly the increased pressure on domestic currencies. However in most emerging markets, the low prices of oil and other commodities continue to cushion consumer inflation pressures. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that real GDP grew by 284 per cent in the third quarter of 2015, compared with 235 per cent in the second quarter. However economic growth in Q3 was lower than the 396 and 623 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 and the corresponding period of 2014, respectively. Both the oil and non-oil sectors contributed to growth in the third quarter of 2015. In the non-oil 5 sector, the key drivers of output growth were Crop Production. Trade and Telecommunications and Information Services, contributing 091, 079 and 040 percentage points, respectively. The overall outlook for economic activity is expected to improve on account of sustained improvement in the supply of power and refined petroleum products, progress with counter-insurgency in the North-East and targeted interventions in the real sector. In addition, the inauguration of the Federal Executive Council and the assumption of office of the Ministers, earlier this month, are expected to add impetus to the growth momentum. The Committee reiterated its commitment to support the various ongoing initiatives of the Federal Government to stimulate output growth. Prices The Committee noted with delight the slight decline in year-on-year headline inflation to 93 per cent in October, from 94 per cent in September, 2015. The decline in headline inflation in October 2015, reflected decreases in both the core and food components. Core inflation declined for the second consecutive month to 87 per cent in October from 89 per cent in September, while food inflation slowed to 101 per cent from 102 per cent over the same period. The Committee further noted the continued moderation in month-on-month inflation and reaffirmed its commitment to price stability, stressing the need for complementary supply side policies as part of an overall strategy to lock-in inflation expectations. Monetary. Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) contracted by 375 per cent in October, 2015, over the level at end-December, 2014. Annualized M2 declined by 50 per cent, which is significantly below the growth benchmark of 1524 per cent for 2015. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 108 per cent, which annualizes to 1435 per cent in the same period. At this level. NDC fell below the provisional benchmark of 2930 per cent for 2015. Growth in aggregate credit reflected mainly growth in net credit to the Federal Government which grew by 9666 per cent in October, although lower than the 14238 per cent in September, 2015. The sharp moderation in credit to government may be partly attributable to the lag effect of implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA). During the period under review, money market interest rates were low but sometimes volatile, reflecting 8 fluctuations in banking system liquidity during the period. Average inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates, which stood at 1550 and 3500 per cent on September 21 and 22, 2015, respectively, fell to 967 and 900 per cent on September 23, 2015. On October 19, 2015. OBB rate closed at 100 per cent with no transaction at the interbank call segment. Following the increase in net liquidity level, the interbank call and OBB rates further declined and closed at 376 and 073 per cent, on October 29 and 30, 2015, respectively. Between the last MPC and end-October 2015, interbank call and OBB rates averaged 666 and 672 per cent, respectively, and were 041 per cent and 133 per cent on 19th November, 2015. The Committee also noted the bearish trend in the equities segment of the capital market during the review period. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) fell by 99 per cent from N1073 trillion to N967 trillion during the same period. However relative to end- December 2014, the indices decreased by 189 and 95 per cent, respectively. These developments reflected, largely the cautious approach to lending by the deposit money banks. External Sector Developments The average naira exchange rate remained relatively stable at both the inter-bank and Bureau-de-Change (BDC) segments of the foreign exchange market during the review period. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N19700/US$ and closed at N19700, with a daily average of N19699/US$ between September 21 and October 30, 2015. At the BDC segment, the 10 exchange rate opened at N22350/US$ and closed at N22500, with a daily average of N22446/US$, representing a depreciation of N150k for the period. The relative stability in the foreign exchange market is attributable to the sustained supply of foreign exchange from autonomous sources as well as the effects of various administrative measures taken by the Bank. Gross official reserves increased from US$2985 billion at th end-September, 2015 to $3031 billion on 20 November, 2015. Committee's Considerations The Committee acknowledged the continued fragile global economic environment, including the possibility of monetary policy normalization in the United States; poor outlook for commodity prices and further slowdown in the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies. The 11 MPC also noted the fragility of the domestic macroeconomic environment; reflected partly in low output growth, soft oil prices, low credit to the high elasticity sectors of the economy and sustained inflationary pressure, which however, softened moderately in October. The MPC was, particularly, concerned that the previous liquidity injections embarked upon through lowering of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), in the last MPC, has not transmitted significantly to improved credit delivery to key growth and employment in sensitive sectors of the economy. Rather credit went to sectors with low employment elasticity. The Committee restated its commitment to evolve and implement measures that would be supportive of consolidating and strengthening output growth, however, with an eye on price stability. The Committee, 12 however, recognized the limits of monetary policy under conditions of huge infrastructure gap and significant global financial market fragilities. While noting the imperative of complementary fiscal policies to augment monetary policy, under the circumstance, monetary policy must remain bold in charting the desired course that would stimulate sustainable output growth in the country. Concerned about the state of unemployment in the country, the MPC evaluated various options for ensuring increased credit delivery to the key growth sectors of the economy, capable of generating employment opportunities, and improving productivity. The Committee underscored the need for the Deposit Money Banks to ensure that measures taken by the Central Bank to inject liquidity and stimulate the economy adequately translate into increased lending to the sectors with 13 sufficient employment capabilities and the potential to generate growth. Accordingly the MPC agreed that going forward any attempt by the CBN at easing liquidity into the system shall be directed at targeting real sector, infrastructure, agriculture and solid minerals. The MPC further directed the Bank's Management to put in place necessary measures/regulations to ensure strict compliance by the DMBs. This is aimed at ensuring that employment and productivity is stimulated while also moderating prices. The Committee noted with satisfaction the stability, soundness and resilience of the banking system even against adverse global financial conditions. Given the situation, the MPC emphasized the necessity of focusing on financial market stability and proactive engagement of policy and administrative levers needed to support the environment in which market institutions operate. On 14 their part, market institutions are encouraged to employ more stringent criteria in evaluating their portfolio and business decisions. The MPC considered that although, headline inflation had remained at the borderline of single digit, the observed moderation, especially in the month-on-month inflation, provided some room for monetary easing to support output in the short to medium term, while keeping in focus the primacy of price stability. In effect, the Committee will continue to monitor developments around the Naira exchange rate, interest rates, and consumer prices, even as target measures are needed to channel liquidity to the key sectors of the economy in an attempt to drive growth. The Committee noted that close coordination between monetary and fiscal policy was imperative for sustainable growth enhancing policies. 15 The Committee's Decisions In consideration of the weakening fundamentals of the economy, particularly the low output growth, rising unemployment and the uncertainty of the global economic environment, the MPC, by a vote of 8 out of 10, reduced the MPR from 130 to 110 per cent while 2 members voted for a retention of the rate at 130 per cent; 7 members voted to reduce the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) from 250 per cent to 200 per cent while 3 members voted to hold. In addition, 8 members voted for an asymmetric corridor of +2/-7 per cent while 2 voted to retain the symmetric corridor of +/-2 per cent around the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). The MPC emphasized that the liquidity arising from the reduction in the CRR to 20 per cent, will only be released 16 to the banks that are willing to channel it to employment generating activities in the economy such as agriculture, infrastructure development, solid minerals and industry. In summary, the MPC voted to: Reduce the CRR from 250 per cent to 200 per cent; Reduce the MPR from 130 per cent to 110 per cent; Change the symmetric corridor of 200 basis points around the MPR to an asymmetric corridor of +200 basis points and -700 basis points, around the MPR. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 24th November 2015 17."
Turkiye,2015-11-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. The composition of growth has shifted towards net exports with the support of rising demand from the European Union economies. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while cumulative exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the impact of the uncertainty in global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Colombia,2015-11-27,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 5.50%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects:Annual consumer inflation in October stood at 5.89%, and the average of the four measures of core inflation posted at 5.11%. These results exceeded the projections of the Central Bank's technical staff and the average of the market. Measures of inflation expectations increased: those of analysts to one and two years registered 4.4% and 3.6%, respectively, while those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are above 4.0%. Annual consumer inflation in October stood at 5.89%, and the average of the four measures of core inflation posted at 5.11%. Acceleration of inflation so far this year is mainly explained by the pass-through of nominal depreciation to consumer prices and the increase in the costs of imported raw materials, as well as by the lower dynamics in food supply. Pass-through of part of the devaluation of the peso to consumer prices and a strong presence of El Nino have slowed down convergence of inflation to the target, due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations, as well as to the probable triggering of indexation mechanisms. The new figures for the third quarter, particularly for retail sales, suggest a more dynamic domestic demand than expected. Net exports would have subtracted from growth. On the supply side, industrial production shows a positive trend and the indicators of shipping and production of cement suggest a favorable dynamics for construction. The monthly indicator of economic activity released by DANE (ISE) suggests a growth rate of around 4.0% in the third quarter. With this information and new data of economic activity for October, the technical staff maintained the growth forecast for 2015 between 2.4% and 3.4%, with 3.0% as the most likely figure. The increase in inflation expectations has considerably reduced the real policy interest rate and those of the financial system. At the same time, domestic credit growth remains above the pace of expansion of output. Figures for global economic activity continue to reflect a weak dynamics of external demand, below that recorded for 2014. In the United States, domestic demand grows at favorable rates, while in the euro zone it is recovering slowly. China continues slowing down, and the major Latin American economies exhibit low growth rates or output contractions. The probability of the FED increasing its benchmark interest rate in December rose and the long-term bond rates increased. The US dollar appreciated and the prices of major commodities declined. The price of oil was below the expectations of the technical staff. The fall in the terms of trade recorded throughout the year has deteriorated national income, largely explaining the higher level of the exchange rate vis--vis the US dollar. In summary, inflation expectations have increased and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand, beyond that which is consistent with the decline registered in national income, has moderated. In order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3.0% target, the Board of Directors decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, thus continuing the tightening of the monetary policy which started last September. The Board reiterates its commitment to the inflation target and continues to carefully monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation, as well as that of asset markets and the international situation.

Poland,2015-12-02,"Warsaw, 2 December 2015 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 1-2 December 2015 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Growth of global economic activity remains moderate. In the euro area and the United States. GDP growth slowed down in 2015 Q3. At the same time, incoming data point to the continuing recovery in these economies in successive quarters. In turn. Russia and Brazil remain in recession. In China. GDP growth in 2015 Q3 decelerated again, but incoming data indicate its stabilisation. Yet, the possibility of a sharper deterioration in economic conditions in the emerging market economies remains a significant source of risk for global growth. Against the renewed fall of commodity prices in recent months, inflation in many economies  including in the United States and the euro area  remains close to zero. Against this background, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are keeping their interest rates close to zero, although the Federal Reserve has announced an interest rate increase in the near future. At the same time, the ECB is continuing its asset purchase programme and is signalling the possibility of a further monetary easing. In Poland, stable economic growth continues. In 2015 Q3 GDP rose slightly faster than in the previous quarter. Consumer demand remains the main driver of economic growth, supported by robust labour market, strong consumer sentiment and increasing household lending. GDP growth is also driven by further, yet slower than in the previous quarter, rise in investment. Corporate investment activity is fuelled by high capacity utilization and firms' good financial performance. Yet, uncertainty about the outlook for economic conditions abroad constrains corporates' propensity to invest. Lower GDP growth in emerging economies also weakens export growth. However, as a slowdown in imports has been even stronger, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth remains positive. Despite improved labour market conditions, wage growth remains moderate. This, together with the continuing negative output gap, does not produce any inflationary pressure in the economy. Both the annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative, although the pace of deflation has recently declined. Deflation persists mainly due to a sharp fall of energy commodity prices in the global markets. Inflation expectations are still very low. 1/2 In the opinion of the Council, price growth will slowly increase in the nearest quarters, supported by the gradual closing of the output gap amidst improving economic conditions in the euro area and the favourable domestic labour market developments. At the same time, the risk of a sharper slowdown in the emerging market economies and the impact this may have on global economic activity, as well as the possibility of commodity prices persisting at low levels, and as a result, low inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, remain the sources of uncertainty about the pace of inflation returning to the target. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, assessing that  considering available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and sustaining macroeconomic balance."
Euroarea,2015-12-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we today conducted a thorough assessment of the strength and persistence of the factors that are currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term and re-examined the degree of monetary accommodation. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective:. First, as regards the key ECB interest rates, we decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.30%. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the marginal lending facility will remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.05% and 0.30% respectively. Second, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, we decided to extend the asset purchase programme (APP). The monthly purchases of €60 billion under the APP are now intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Third, we decided to reinvest the principal payments on the securities purchased under the APP as they mature, for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. Fourth, we decided to include, in the public sector purchase programme, euro-denominated marketable debt instruments issued by regional and local governments located in the euro area in the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases by the respective national central banks. Fifth, we decided to continue conducting the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2017. Today's decisions were taken in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% and thereby to anchor medium-term inflation expectations. The latest staff projections incorporate the favourable financial market developments following our last monetary policy meeting. They still indicate continued downside risks to the inflation outlook and slightly weaker inflation dynamics than previously expected. This follows downward revisions in earlier projection exercises. The persistence of low inflation rates reflects sizeable economic slack weighing on domestic price pressures and headwinds from the external environment. Our new measures will ensure accommodative financial conditions and further strengthen the substantial easing impact of the measures taken since June 2014, which have had significant positive effects on financing conditions, credit and the real economy. Today's decisions also reinforce the momentum of the euro area's economic recovery and strengthen its resilience against recent global economic shocks. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution in the outlook for price stability and, if warranted, is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. In particular, the Governing Council recalls that the APP provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter, most likely on account of a continued positive contribution from consumption alongside more muted developments in investment and exports. The most recent survey indicators point to ongoing real GDP growth in the final quarter of the year. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the earlier progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, low oil prices should provide support for households' real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. In addition, government expenditure is likely to increase in some parts of the euro area, reflecting measures in support of refugees. However, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets and moderate global trade, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. This outlook is broadly reflected in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Compared with the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the prospects for real GDP growth are broadly unchanged. The risks to the euro area growth outlook relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy as well as to broader geopolitical risks. These risks have the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports and on confidence more widely. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.1% in November 2015, unchanged from October but lower than expected. This reflected somewhat weaker price increases in services and industrial goods, mainly compensated for by a less negative contribution from energy prices. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to rise at the turn of the year, mainly on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. During 2016 and 2017, inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further, supported by our previous monetary policy measures  and supplemented by those announced today  the expected economic recovery, and the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution of inflation rates over the period ahead. This broad pattern is also reflected in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.1% in 2015, 1.0% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017. In comparison with the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down slightly. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (M3), with the annual rate of growth of M3 increasing to 5.3% in October 2015 from 4.9% in September. Annual growth in M3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 11.8% in October, after 11.7% in September. Loan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.6% in October, up from 0.1% in September. Despite these improvements, developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.2% in October, compared with 1.1% in September. Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for both firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary stimulus in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the beneficial effects of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial for confidence in our fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Armenia,2015-12-05,"PRESS RELEASE 12.05.2015 At the meeting dated May 12 2015, the Board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia decided to leave the Refinancing Rate unchanged, 10.5%. There was 0.4% of deflation in April of 2015 compared with 0.5% of inflation recorded in the same month last year. The 12-month inflation rate reduced to 4.8% late in the month. According to actual developments, trends of slow global economic growth persisted in the external sector, under which circumstance international markets of basic commodities and food products continued seeing deflationary patterns. Based on these developments, the Board of the Central Bank admits that deflationary effects from the external sector in the coming months are likely. The Board of the Central Bank states that over the first quarter of the year the domestic economic activity indicator posted 2.5% growth due to higher-than-expected growth in agriculture and smaller decline in construction. Positive developments in agriculture will also lead to a greater seasonal drop in food prices. On the other hand, the Central Bank estimates that possible rise in electricity prices in an upcoming period will drive the aforementioned deflationary effects out while the current level of the Refinancing Rate will help the 12-month inflation rate stabilize around the target by the end of the year. Later, as economic developments unfold, the Central Bank will adjust its monetary policy directions, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium-term perspective. Detailed information on the setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q2, 2015) due on May 22, 2015. Press Service of the Central Bank."
South Korea,2015-12-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the modest improvements in the euro area have continued. Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by heightened international financial market volatility due for example to a shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, although domestic demand activities have sustained their paces of recovery, driven by consumption, the trend of declining exports has persisted while the improvement in economic agents' sentiments has been inadequate. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has increased steadily, and in October the unemployment rate fell compared to that in October of last year while the employment-to-population ratio maintained the same level. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation rose from 0.9% the month before to 1.0% in November, due mainly to a narrowing of the scale of decline in petroleum product prices and to expansions in the extents of increase in service fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose to 2.4%, from 2.3% in October. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the effects of the low oil prices. In the housing market, meanwhile, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have persisted in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, influenced mostly by expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, stock prices have fallen, long-term market interest rates have risen, and the Korean won has depreciated against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as any changes in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy or in economic conditions in emerging market countries including China, the movements of capital flows, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Russia,2015-12-11,"On 11 December 2015, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 11.00 percent per annum, in recognition of growing inflation risks, while the risks of economic cooling remain. The annual pace of consumer price growth in the end of 2016 is estimated to be about 6%, on the way to reach the target of 4% in 2017. As inflation slows down in line with the forecast and on condition inflation risks recede, the Bank of Russia will continue with a downward revision of its key rate, to be decided at one of its forthcoming Board of Directors meetings. In the November to early December 2015 period, inflation slowdown continued. The Bank of Russia estimates the annual growth pace of consumer prices to total 14.8% as of 7 December, on 15.6% in October. Seasonally adjusted monthly inflation was down from 0.9% between August and October to 0.7% in November. Consumer prices were rising slower thanks to the beneficial agricultural environment and a gradual exhaustion of the impact from the depreciation of the ruble of the July to August period, as well the weakness in consumer demand driven by low growth in nominal household incomes. The downturn in annual inflation is further explained by the sharp increase in consumer prices seen one year ago (the base effect). However, the slowdown in consumer prices occurred somewhat slower than predicted. In addition, inflation expectations of households escalated in November, although projected to decrease. The restraining pressure on prices also comes from the moderately tight monetary conditions. Money supply (M2) growth rates increased but still remain low. The downward trend in lending and deposit rates, driven by the Bank of Russia's previous key rate reductions, has slowed down. Deposit and lending rates remain at the level which, on the one hand, serves to keep ruble savings attractive and, on the other hand, along with high debt burden and tightened creditworthiness requirements, is a factor behind low annual lending expansion. According to Rosstat's tentative estimates, the annual pace of GDP drop decreased in Q3. Having said this, the mixed dynamics seen in core macroeconomic indicators for October speak for instability of this trend. While industrial output and investment contracted at a slower pace than before, contraction in consumer demand accelerated. As demographic conditions remain negative, unemployment was still low; the labour market was adjusting to the new conditions largely through declining real wages and wider part-time employment. The current trends are expected to persist in the coming months. The modest growth of household income and retail lending will continue to contain consumer spending. Investment activity will remain weak amid the persisting economic uncertainty and the relatively tough lending conditions. Investment demand is expected to be constrained also by limited potential substitution of external finance with domestic one, following the narrow nature of the Russian financial market and high debt load of companies. Investment is likely to be supported somewhat by the governmental turnaround programme. In an unfavourable environment in the global commodity markets, exports in value terms are expected to go down. At the same time a weaker internal demand will cause a more significant decrease in imports in value terms. As a result, net exports will be a positive contributor to the annual output growth. Further economic development will depend on the pace of the economy's adjustment to the recent external shocks. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, gradual easing of internal financial conditions, lower debt burden and improved business sentiment in 2016 H2 will pave the way for investment and production recovery in 2017. It will consequently result in growing household income contributing to the revival of consumer demand in 2018. In 2017, the economic growth rate will stand at 0.0-1.0%. The annual inflation will drop in early 2016 following its high value in early 2015, among other things. The external trade restrictions imposed against Turkey from January 2016 will not have a significant impact on consumer prices. These restrictions are estimated to add about 0.2-0.4 pp to inflation till the end of 2015 and in early 2016. The slack domestic demand and the relatively tough monetary conditions will drag down annual inflation in 2016-2017. A slowdown in the consumer price growth will create prerequisites for decrease in inflation expectations. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, the annual consumer price growth will stand at about 6% in late 2016, on track to reach the 4% target in 2017, facilitated by the current monetary policy. The key sources of inflation risks are possible further worsening of the external climate against the backdrop of persistently low oil prices, monetary policy normalisation by key central banks and continued slowdown in the Chinese economic growth. Besides, inflation reduction can be hampered by persistently high inflation expectations, and an upward revision, planned for 2016-2017, of rates and prices in the regulated sector, an upward revision of social payments indexation, as well as overall budget policy easing. As inflation slows down in line with the forecast and provided that inflation risks recede, the Bank of Russia will continue with a downward revision of its key rate, to be decided at one of its forthcoming Board of Directors meetings. The Bank of Russia will hold its next rate review meeting on 29 January 2016. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Peru,2015-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2015 BCRP RAISES THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 3.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 bps to 3.75 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with an inflation that foresees that inflation will converge to the target range in 2016, but takes into account the following factors: Inflation expectations are above the inflation target range. Inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors such as the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as by the depreciation of the nuevo sol against the dollar, the effect of these factors not being foreseen to extend in a general manner to the rest of prices. Economic activity has been recovering gradually. International indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as volatility in external financial markets and foreign exchange markets. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and stands ready to make adjustments in its monetary policy rate to lead inflation to the target range in the policy horizon, should it be necessary. Inflation in November recorded a rate of 0.34 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.66 in October to 4.17 percent in November. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of perishable food products. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.12 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation registered 3.46 percent in November, a similar rate to that observed in the previous month. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations show an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels, but with a faster pace of growth in the fourth quarter of the year. It is estimated that the economy will be growing at rates similar to those of the potential output in 2016. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to raise the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the following twelve months will be approved on the Board meetings to be held according to the following schedule: January 14 February 11 March 10 April 14 May 12 June 9 July 14 August 11 September 8 October 13 November 10 December 15 In 2016 the BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates: March 18 June 17 September 16 December 16."
Czech Republic,2015-12-16,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. According to the forecast, inflation will increase and hit the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. In 2017, it will be slightly above the target. According to the forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur from early 2017. The Bank Board therefore assessed the risks to the current forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being broadly balanced. A need to maintain significantly expansionary monetary conditions persists. The Bank Board's repeated statements that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the second half of 2016 remain valid. At the same time, the Bank Board stated again that the likely timing of the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment is around the end of 2016. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate at the monetary policy horizon to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to domestic prices and other nominal variables. Annual headline inflation has been falling so far in Q4. In November it was only 0.1%, i.e. 0.5 percentage point below the CNB forecast. This deviation was due predominantly to food prices, whose growth almost halted, whereas the forecast had expected it to accelerate. Administered prices and fuel prices also declined more sharply than forecasted. By contrast, core inflation (adjusted inflation excluding fuels) was slightly above the forecast. In recent months, this indicator of core inflation has been affected by growth of the domestic economy and wages and by depreciation of the koruna against the dollar. However, these effects are being largely offset by a continued decline in foreign producer prices. The growth rate of the Czech economy slowed somewhat to 4.5% in Q3, whereas the forecast had expected it to accelerate slightly. The 0.3 percentage point deviation of GDP growth from the forecast was due to a smaller contribution of household consumption. Annual growth in total investment was also slightly below the CNB forecast. However, fixed investment was a moderately positive surprise and the resulting overall downward deviation was thus due solely to the traditionally volatile inventories. All components of domestic demand contributed to the year-on-year increase in GDP. The contribution of net exports was again slightly negative. New information on developments abroad obtained from the December Consensus Forecasts suggests that demand in the effective euro area will continue to rise at a steady pace close to 2%. By contrast, the forecast for euro area producer prices has been revised downwards for the rest of this year and the first half of next year. Growth in producer prices is still not expected to resume until next year as the effect of the fall in oil prices unwinds. The outlook for consumer price inflation has been lowered only slightly. Inflation in the effective euro area is thus expected to rise gradually from close to zero this year towards 2% at the close of next year. The market outlook for the three-month Euribor has declined by 0.1 percentage point on average and is slightly negative for the next two years. The shift of the interest rate outlook compared to the assumptions of the current forecast reflects continued subdued inflation in the euro area and the reaction of the European Central Bank, which lowered its deposit rate to a more negative level and extended its quantitative easing programme at least until the end of March 2017. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price in the next two years has been lowered significantly. The Brent price is therefore expected to rise only gradually until the end of 2017, from its current level below USD 40 a barrel to around USD 54 a barrel. However, this factor represents a positive supply-side shock to the Czech economy and the Bank Board points out that its first-round effects are exempted as a rule. Compared with the assumptions of the current forecast, the outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate has shifted to a weaker level. The rapid domestic economic growth is fostering a further improvement in the labour market situation, broadly in line with the forecast. Annual growth in total employment again exceeded 1% in 2015 Q3. Growth in labour demand is also documented by a high number of vacancies, which has been above 100,000 for several months, roughly double the level of a year earlier. The general unemployment rate fell further in Q3 and the decline in the seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons has also continued in Q4 so far. At the end of November, labour offices registered around 431,000 job applicants, 86,000 fewer than in the same period of last year. Annual growth in the average wage in the economy accelerated to 3.8% in Q3, driven by the business sector, and was therefore slightly above the forecast. Indicators from the real economy point to continued robust economic growth in 2015 Q4. Industrial production and retail sales are also still rising apace year on year in both the automotive and non-automotive segments. Only construction output saw a slight year-on-year decline in October for the first time in quite a while, amid continuing growth in civil engineering construction related to government investment in infrastructure. The price decrease in manufacturing, which had been deepening since June 2015, has moderated somewhat in Q4 so far. Following more than two years of decline, agricultural producer prices returned to year-on-year growth. Prices in market services were flat year on year, whereas construction work prices continued to rise moderately. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, annual GDP growth was slightly below the forecast in 2015 Q3 and inflation was markedly lower than forecasted in November. By contrast, the average wage increased slightly faster than expected in Q3, owing to developments in the business sector. Unemployment has been approximately in line with the forecast so far in Q4."
Georgia,2015-12-16,"16.12.15 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 50 Basis Points to 8.0%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 16, 2015 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 8.0 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the tightening of the monetary policy by the National Bank of Georgia must have positive effect on the decrease in inflation expectations. Unless other additional shocks take place, further monetary tightening in the coming periods is not to be expected. According to the current forecast, in the beginning of 2016 the inflation will remain above its target value, will start gradual decreasing afterwards and will return to its target value of 5% in the second half of 2016. The annual growth in consumer prices equaled 6.3% in November. The main factors causing rise in inflation are still coming from the supply side, namely the increase in the intermediate costs of production and higher prices on certain imported goods. An important impact on the inflation came from the one-time increase in the electricity tariff. The rise in inflation has been limited by the weak aggregate demand and decrease in the world prices of oil and food products. The real GDP growth in the second quarter was consistent with the forecasts. According to preliminary forecasts the real growth in the first 10 months of the year was 2.8%. The factor hindering the growth is the external sector, which, given the dire economic situation in the region negatively affects the income from export of goods and services. The economic growth in the past period was mostly due to the domestic demand, which is however negatively affected by the decline in remittances and increase in the service burden of foreign currency denominated loans due to the changes in the GEL/USD exchange rate. There have been some positive developments in relation to the elimination of external imbalance. Given the decrease in foreign currency inflows the change in the exchange rate has caused import to adjust. In the last three months imports have decreased by 18 percent (excluding one-offs). Accordingly we can assume that the impact of the existing external shock on the exchange rate has been exhausted. Other things equal no additional pressure can be expected on the exchange rate coming from the existing external shock. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. Further changes in monetary policy will depend on the inflation forecast and factors affecting it, global and regional economic environment and general economic conditions. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on February 3, 2016."
Philippines,2015-12-16,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of inflation dynamics and the risks to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that average inflation would likely settle below the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2015. However, inflation is seen to return gradually to a path consistent with the inflation target for2016-2017, as the effects of recent weather disturbances continue to be felt. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored within the inflation target band for 2016 and 2017. Potential upside pressures could come from the impact of prolonged El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates as well as pending petitions for power rate adjustments, while downside risks could arise from possible slower-than-expected global economic activity. The Monetary Board also observed that domestic demand conditions are likely to stay firm, supported by solid private household and capital spending, buoyant market sentiment, and adequate domestic liquidity. In addition, the Monetary Board has considered the potential impact of the recent monetary policy adjustment in the US on global financial conditions, noting that keeping monetary policy settings steady at this juncture would allow the BSP some room to continue to assess evolving global economic conditions and calibrate its policy tools as appropriate. With these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings are appropriate given the outlook for inflation and domestic economic activity. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor domestic and external developments to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains in line with price and financial stability."
United States,2015-12-16,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Jerome H Powell; Daniel K Tarullo; and John C Williams."
Chile,2015-12-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 December 2015 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.5%. The external scenario continues to show a deterioration of emerging economies, largely due to a relapse of commodity prices and not-so-favorable global financial conditions. The world economic outlook posted no major change from last month, although lately the global growth forecast has been reduced. The Federal Reserve increased the policy rate, causing no immediate disruption in the global financial markets. On the domestic front, annual CPI inflation declined to 3.9%, but is expected to again exceed 4% shortly. Core inflation —the CPIEFE— is still close to 5% y-o-y. Meanwhile, inflation expectations two years out remain at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with speciall attention. Partial fourth-quarter data continue to show limited growth in domestic output and demand. Confidence indicators remain in pessimistic territory. Job creation and wage growth are still dynamic. The future path of the monetary policy rate considers measured adjustments aimed to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2015-12-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 17, 2015 In its meeting on December 17, the MPC decided to reconvene on Thursday 24, 201. The CBE is keen on fulfilling its mandate of price stability for the purpose of sustainable economic growth and job creatio. This mandate is only achievable through full coordination and commitment on macroeconomic objectives with the government, including targets for fiscal consolidation, current account outturns and the implementation of urgent structural economic reform. The CBE will discuss with the government these objectives during the first Coordinating Council meeting scheduled on December 1."
Ukraine,2015-12-17,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine decided to leave discount rate at 22% per annum. Decision of the Board of keeping restrained monetary policy corresponds with the mandate of the National Bank of ensuring price stability. It is due to the need to ease the possible negative impact of external economic factors on the prices and support for deceleration of inflation up to 12% as of the end of 2016. Inflationary dynamics in November meets as a whole the expectations of the National Bank. Consumer inflation in annual terms (46.6%) remained almost within the frames of the previous month. However, core inflation continued to decline  up to 37.9% compared with 40.1% in the month earlier. The above mentioned shows that the disinflation trend remains, the fundamental factor of this are the domestic demand weakness and restrained monetary policy. The National Bank expects this trend to continue. Depressed consumer demand continues to identify downward inflationary dynamics. The low energy recourses cost on the world markets also contributes to it. Despite these expectations, the Board of the National Bank is aware of the present risks of the pressure increase on the prices. The main source of this pressure is that demand for Ukrainian exports remains low. The risks also are the rising the discount rate launched by the US Federal Reserve for the first time since 2006; as well as the devaluation of countries  trade partners' currencies. In the coming months the volatility in the exchange rate observed in October-November 2015 may also reflect on inflation with some delay. Another factor of inflation escalation is the possible increase of excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Given the mentioned factors and adhering to its mandate of price stability, the National Bank deems necessary to maintain current monetary conditions primarily to restrain inflationary expectations. This decision will also contribute to the increase of savings on bank deposits. In the future, provided that the disinflationary trend remains, inflationary expectations improve and risks are mitigated, the National Bank may resume the gradual easing of monetary policy. Decision on the discount rate change is approved by the National Bank of Ukraine Resolution # 894 ""On regulation of the currency market"" on 17 December, 2015. The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has also decided starting from 10 January, 2016 to stop crediting cash balances in the bank cash departments in national currency in settle for mandatory reserve requirement. The current ratio today allows banks to credit 75% of cash in the bank cash department in local currency to satisfy its mandatory reserves. In making this decision, the Board came from the fact that systematic measures to clean up the banking system contributed to strengthening its stability and liquidity. As of 17 December, 2015 the funds volume on bank correspondent accounts increased by 25% since the beginning of the year - up to UAH 33.9 bn. At the same time the volume of temporary free bank funds, invested by the banks in deposit certificates of the National Bank increased by 3.4 times since the beginning of the year - up to UAH 66 bn. This allows to gradually abandoning the temporary measures of the banking system support, which were used in acute financial situation and moving on to the standard principles of mechanism of compulsory provisions making. The decision on statutory provisions is approved by the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine Resolution # 893 on 17 December, 2015 ""On Amendments to the Resolution of the National Bank of Ukraine of 18 December, 2014 #820"". The next meeting of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine on monetary policy will take place on 28 January, 2016 according to the approved schedule."
Colombia,2015-12-18,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 5.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In November, annual consumer inflation was 6.39%, surpassing the forecast of the technical staff at the Central Bank and of the market. The average of the four measures of core inflation stood at 5.4%, and measures of inflation expectations remain high: those by analysts to one and two years increased to 4.6% and 3.8%, respectively; those inferred from public debt bonds to 2, 3 and 5 years do not show significant changes and remain above 4.5%. Acceleration of inflation so far this year is mainly explained by the pass-through of nominal depreciation of the peso to consumer prices and to the costs of imported raw materials, as well as by the lower dynamics in food supply. The pass-through of part of the devaluation of the peso to consumer prices and a strong presence of El Nino have slowed down convergence of inflation to the target due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations, as well as to the probable triggering of indexation mechanisms. Economic growth recorded for the third quarter of 2015 was higher than projected. Regarding the second quarter, the rate of increase in consumption was higher, while investment registered a similar rate. Net exports subtracted from growth. With this information and activity data for the fourth quarter, the technical staff forecasts a growth figure close to 3.0% for all of 2015. Figures for global economic activity continue to reflect a weak dynamics of external demand, below that recorded for 2014. In the United States, domestic demand grows at favorable rates, while in the euro zone it is recovering slowly. In China, the information available suggests that its economy would have ceased to slow down. The major economies in Latin America recorded low growths or contractions in their output. The Federal Reserve of the United States increased the benchmark interest rate and is likely to continue doing so gradually. The price of oil continued to decline and stood at levels lower than had been estimated for the end of the year. This drop represents a further deterioration of the country's terms of trade, national income, and deficit in the current account of the balance of payments. In this environment, and with the beginning of a gradual tightening of the monetary policy in the United States, the country's risk premium increased and the peso continued to depreciate vis--vis the US dollar. In synthesis, higher-than-expected increases in food prices and further increases in the exchange rate related largely to the fall in the price of oil generate new inflationary pressures. At the same time, inflation expectations remain high and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand, beyond that which is consistent with the decline exhibited in national income, has moderated. In order to ensure convergence of inflation towards the target range within the horizon announced last month, the Board of Directors decided to continue tightening the monetary policy, as it started doing in September, and increased the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp. The Board reiterates its commitment to the inflation target and continues to carefully monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as that of asset markets and the international situation.

Armenia,2015-12-22,"PRESS RELEASE 22.12.2015 At the December 22, 2015 Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to lower the refinancing rate by 1.0 pp to 8.75%. In November 2015, inflation was 0.6%, compared to 1.3% inflation to the same reference month last year. As a result, 12-month inflation continued to decline, reaching 1.2% at the end of November 2015. The decrease in inflation is still due to low prices of agricultural products and decline in prices for some imported goods. As to the external sector, the trends of slow growth of the global economy and the continuous decline in prices in the international commodity markets remained. The Central Bank Board estimates that these developments have contributed to the decline in inflation. The situation will continue in the upcoming months having deflationary impact on domestic prices. The Board notes that in January-November 2015 the economic activity compared to the same period of 2014 was 2.9%, which was mostly driven by growth in agriculture and mining. Despite the expansionary impact of fiscal policy in 2015, the domestic demand remains weak. Due to such circumstances low inflation contributed to decrease in inflationary expectations, which under the weak domestic demand and external deflationary trends will be maintaining low inflationary environment. Central Bank Board believes that inflation risks that emerged at the end of last year have already largely been overcome and, due to easing of monetary conditions in recent months and especially the sharp easing at present, there is a return now to the normal situation that existed before November 2014. The Central Bank Board estimates that low inflation will persist in the upcoming months, and then will expand slowly as a result of the outlined policies stabilizing around the target in the forecast horizon. Subject to anchoring of inflationary expectations and the absence of additional domestic and external risks, the Central Bank Board will continue to ease the monetary conditions.

India,2015-12-22,"Summary of the Electronic Consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy: November 2015 Consultation with external Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy was held electronically between November 20 and 24, 2015 in the run up to the Fifth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review, 2015-16 on December 1, 2015. The main points suggested by Members are set out below. Members expressed concern that the global demand is still weak. The coming month is likely to see divergence in policies of major central banks. The Federal Reserve is likely to announce a rate increase in December as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) grows confident that low inflation will rebound and employment will move below the natural rate. At this juncture, it is unlikely that US growth will slow below trend. With US GDP approximating 2.1 per cent in Q3 of 2015, actual growth may even exceed estimates of US potential growth suggesting impending price pressures. Given this, the FOMC may feel that it may be appropriate to initiate the normalization process in the December meeting. Other central banks however have not been particularly successful to pull off the zero lower bound  the European Central Bank is likely to expand asset purchases and possibly further cut its already negative deposit rate. Bank of Japan witnessing domestic recession will also amplify its expansionary policy, and the People's Bank of China will attempt to add stimulus to the economy as well. On domestic growth, pending the GDP release on November 30. Members felt that demand, as also credit growth continue to be weak with no significant change since the last policy announcement. The reduction in area sown under rabi along with the marginal increase in kharif production indicates agricultural output is either stable or declining this year. A small improvement in manufacturing, and muted overall positive change in service sector economic activity, indicate an economy that is still picking itself up. Indicators of investment demand pick up are scarce and the stress of bank balance sheets is still palpable. The most recent (September) IIP remains subdued, with only consumption of durables displaying robust growth. There is some growth in the capital goods sector reflecting the complementarity between public infrastructure capital and private investment. Given the complementarity, it is unlikely that private investment will take-off unless there is a sustained increase in public investment in the economy. There is also the issue of poor balance sheets of the corporate sector, especially in the infrastructure sector. The continuation of binding constraints to fresh capex spending would hinder private investment despite monetary policy being accommodative. Net exports, subdued because of secular stagnation and global slack, continue to pose downside risks to growth. Better revenue receipts garnered by the government is more due to increases in excise and service tax rates and cess than due to the underlying buoyancy of the economy. The recent improvement in the fiscal position could be negated by the implementation of One Rank One Pension and the Seventh Central Pay Commission (CPC) Award. The implementation of VII CPC proposals is likely to provide some demand stimulus for industry. If the government off-sets higher government consumption (on wages and pensions) through the VII CPC with lower2 spending elsewhere, the inflationary impact may be limited. With growth slowing in the last quarter in the US and Euro area. India's exports are likely to face a contraction. Members felt that in all likelihood there prevails a slim negative output gap. However, they opined, real sector policies are important to address this rather than monetary policy. Members noted that inflation surprised on the upside with headline inflation rising sharply to 5 per cent in October, core CPI to 4.6 per cent, and ‘core-core' (CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel) to 5.3 per cent. Food inflation also increased to 5.3 per cent in October with price pressures largely driven by pulses and onions. Notwithstanding the relative unreliability of survey-based inflation expectation measures (over market based ones), spike in pulses inflation of 42 per cent is likely to unmoor inflationary expectations making the downward movement of inflationary expectations unlikely in the short term. Volatility in specific components (like food) may make the anchoring of inflationary expectations challenging. On external sector developments. Members expected currency to be volatile in the coming months due to sharp variations in monetary policy stances of major central banks around the world. With currency risk likely to become a large basis for turbulence, foreign exchange concerns will have a bearing on the investment climate and will require the focus to managing currency volatility. Inflation due to volatility in weather and seasonal disturbances may recede in importance relative to inflation due to external changes from exchange rates and asset prices. Four of the five Members recommended status quo in the present policy. The reasons for a pause given by the Members were: first, headline CPI as well as measures of core inflation have risen sharply  while global commodity prices continue to impart some disinflationary momentum, there are some upside risks to inflation from ‘inflation-internals' (negative monsoon shocks, binding supply side constraints, government consumption shocks such as the VII CPC). Firming up of inflation warrants monetary policy to be cautious as it keeps its immediate target of 6 per cent in its sight. Members felt that the rising inflation itself should warrant no change in financial accommodation. They were of the view that the bar for any further accommodation should increase as the Reserve Bank shifts towards inflation in the medium term. Second, with headline inflation at 5 per cent, the real policy repo rate was at 1.75 per cent. This is in the middle of the Reserve Bank's preferred 1.5-2.0 per cent real neutral rate range, suggesting that policy is currently neutral. Third, there prevails a slim negative output gap that needs to be addressed by real sector policies rather than monetary policy. Fourth, since the last policy was frontloaded, it should be allowed to work through the system. Fifth, sharp variations in monetary policy stances of major central banks around the world in the coming month will lead to currency volatility. All these suggested a pause in any rate action by the Reserve Bank. On guidance, one of the Members recommended that the Reserve Bank should mention that the current accommodative stance will be data dependent (since data can surprise on both the upside and downside). The fifth Member recommended a rate cut by 25 basis points since CPI inflation was low. The Member assumed that Central Government will meet its fiscal and revenue deficit targets in 2016-17. All the five external Members  Dr.Shankar Acharya. Dr.Arvind Virmani. Prof. Errol D'Souza. Prof. Ashima Goyal, and Prof. Chetan Ghate  sent their feedback through e-mail. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing main points of discussions held in the meetings of TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting/consultation.

Turkiye,2015-12-22," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. The composition of growth has shifted towards net exports with the support of rising demand from the European Union economies. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while cumulative exchange rate movements delay the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the impact of the uncertainty in global markets on inflation expectations and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. The Committee indicated that, should the decline in volatility observed after the start of the global policy normalization persist, monetary policy simplification steps would begin with the next meeting. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Egypt,2015-12-24,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 24, 2015 In its meeting held on December 24, 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 bps to 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised to 975 percen. During the Coordinating Council meeting on December 17, the government and the CBE have decided to collaborate on designing a macroeconomic framework, aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability that will contribute positively to economic growth and job creatio. The next meeting is scheduled on January 10, 201. The key elements of the framework include but are not limited to:  Narrowing the country's fiscal deficit to sustainable levels in order to alleviate the pressure on domestic liquidity, avail greater resources to the private sector to increase production, and hence reduce the consequent inflationary pressures from money creatio. Maintaining price stability by avoiding double digit inflation rates over the medium- ter. Reducing the country's trade deficit by initiating a strategy aimed at encouraging local production to meet domestic market needs and enhance imports substitution. Stepping up the structural economic reform agenda to raise the economy's potential output, by addressing the impediments that challenge increasing investment. In connection to the latest inflation outturn, inflationary pressures have been slowly building up as evident in the increase in non-food prices, which have contributed to headline and core inflation rate. Annual headline CPI jumped to 1108 percent in November from 970 percent in October, partly on the back of unfavorable base effect from last year, while core inflation increased to 744 percent from 626 percent in Octobe. Looking ahead, while upside risks to the inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of broad-based declines in international commodity prices, underlying domestic inflationary pressures could push up inflation expectation. On the other hand, real GDP grew robustly by 42 percent in 2014/15 after recording 22 percent (y/y) growth in 2013/1. The main contributors to growth were the manufacturing, construction, real estate and tourism sectors, while the extractions sector remained wea. In the meantime, strong investment growth more than compensated for the negative contribution of net export. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks and uncertainty that surround the global economy on the back of softening growth in emerging markets and challenges facing the Euro Area could pose downside risks to domestic GDP. In view of the above and given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks, the MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to address inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectation. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Israel,2015-12-28,"Governor RemarksBackground conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor November declined by 0.4 percent, while forecasters had projected a decline of 0.2 percent, on average. There was a marked decline in the fruit and vegetables component (-1.8 percent), while there was a seasonal increasein the clothing and footwear component (2.6 percent). The housing component remained unchanged. The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was negative 0.9 percent, compared with an inflation rate of negative 0.7 percent over the 12 months that ended in October. Prices of CPI components representing tradable goods declined by 3.1 percent over the past 12 months, while CPI components representing nontradable items increased by 0.4 percent. Excluding energy and administrative pricedeclines (such as the reductions in water and electricity rates), the CPI increased by 0.8 percent over the past 12 months. The additional price reductions at the government's initiative are expected to reduce the CPI by about 0.4 percentage points in the coming months. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Short-term inflation expectations continued to decline, against the background of the decline in oil prices and the initiated price reductions: Privateforecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.5 percent (compared to 0.7 percent last month), and expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates are for an inflationrate of 0.2 percent (compared to 0.3 percent last month). One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market are negative 0.1 percent, and two-year inflation expectations are 0.4 percent. Medium-term (3-5 years) and long-term (5 C2 AD-10 years) forward expectations remained anchored within the inflation target. The Telbor curve increased slightly in the past month, and reflects some probability of an interest rate increase in a year. Similar to last month, private forecasters expect the Bank of Israel interest rate to remain at its current level in the next few months, and to increase in about a year. Real economic activity: Indicators that became available this month point to the growth environment of recent months: about 2.5 percent: continuing in the fourth quarter. The security situation is mainly affecting tourism: the number of touristentries declined by about 0.5 percent in November, following a decline of about 7 percent in October (seasonally adjusted): with only a limited effect on consumer confidence indices. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim declined moderately in November, while there was an improvement in the index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Foreign trade data indicate an increase of 4.3 percent in goods exports in November (in current dollar terms, excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds), and the figure for October was revised upward. However, the level of exports inOctober-November remained about 1.4 percent lower than the averagein June-August. Exports in the medium-high technology industries continued to contract against the background of the decline in commodity prices and the slowdown in Europe and in China. However, exports in high technology industries accelerated. Goods imports declined by 5 percent in November, following an increase of 8 percent in October, while the level of imports in September: November was 3 percent lower than in the three preceding months. Exports of business services (excluding startups) increased by 3.5 percent in October. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in November, led by goods exports and the job vacancy rate. Preliminary data from the Companies Survey indicate a slight improvement compared with the third quarter. The Purchasing Managers Index increased to 52.5 points in November, indicating expansion of manufacturing activity for the second straight month. The labor market: The public sector wageagreement reached by the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor) and the Ministry of Finance, in addition to natural wage creep, are expected to leadto a moderate increase in real wages in the public sector. The Labor ForceSurvey for November continues to indicate a low unemployment rate (4.6 percent among the prime working ages (25-64)), and despite a slight worsening, the employment rate (76.2 percent) and participation rate (79.9 percent) remain high. The number of employee posts declined by 0.5 percent inSeptember compared with August, and is similar to its level at the beginning of the year. Nominal and real wages increased by 0.9 percent in the third quarter relative to the second quarter (seasonally adjusted data), and there was an increase of 2.4 percent in business sector wages since the beginning of the year, reflected in increases in most industries. Health tax receipts for September-November were approximately 4.4 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. The job vacancy rate increased slightly in November, to 3.3 percent, and remained at historically high levels. Budget data: In January-November, the domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 3.9 billion. Total tax revenues since the beginning of the year are aboutNIS 3.7 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the tax revenue forecast, and about 7.2 percent higher in real terms than the same period last year. Gross domestic VAT revenues increased by about 10.7 percent in real terms since the beginning of the year, compared with the corresponding period in 2014. Domestic government expenditure since the beginning of the year is about 5.2 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period last year. Staff forecast: This month, the ResearchDepartment updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. The forecast reflects more moderate assessments of activity, inflation and interest rates than the previous forecast last quarter. The inflation rate is expected to be 0.8 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, and to return to within the target range at the beginning of 2017. The Bank of Israel interest rate is expected, according to the staff forecast, to remain at 0.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2016, and to increase to 0.25 percent at the end ofthe year. The interest rate is expected to remain lower than the US federal funds rate for some time. GDP is expected to grow in 2016 by 2.8 percent (compared 3.3 percent in the previous forecast) and by 3.1 percent in 2017. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on November 22, 2015, through December 25, 2015, the shekel weakened by 0.4 percent against the dollar and in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by 2.9 percent against the euro. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on November 22, 2015, through December 25, 2015, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 3.7 percent.Nominal short-term yields increased by up to 5 basis points, with a flattening of the curve, while short-term yields on the CPI-indexed curve increased by up to 16 basis points with a flattening of the curve. The makam yield curve traded slightly above the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, was virtually unchanged at 78 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in November, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 43.1 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 14.5 percent. The credit market: In October, business sector debt totaled NIS 822 billion: an increase of about NIS 2 billion derived from new bank loans taken out and from the issue of tradable bonds. In November, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 1.6 billion, lower than the average over the past 12 months (about NIS 2.4 billion). Corporate bond market spreads increased slightly, and withdrawals from mutual funds continued. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 1.3 billion (0.4 percent) in October, to a total of about NIS 457 billion. More than half of the increase (NIS 0.9 billion) was generated by housing debt, which totals NIS 319 billion. The volume of new mortgages takenout in November was NIS 5.2 billion: similar to the average of the previous 12 months (NIS 5.3 billion). In November, mortgage interest rates remained virtually unchanged in all tracks. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) remained unchanged in November, after declining by 0.4 percent in October. Over the past 12 months, it has increased by 1.9 percent: lower than the average for that range over the past three years. In September-October, home prices increased by 0.8 percent, and in the 12 months ending in October, they increased by 6.9 percent. There were 6,600 transactions in October, similar to the averagefor July-September and lower than the average of 9,100 transactions in the first half of the year. An analysis of transactions by type of purchaser shows that most of the decline is among investors: affected by the increase in the purchase tax at the end of June. The stock of homes for sale continued its slow downward trend, at approximately 26,300 homes, about 60 percent of which are by private initiative. There has been a gradual decline in this stock, while there has been a continued increase in the stock of homes by government initiative. There were 11,000 housing units completed in the third quarter, and the high rate of building starts in the past year (about 47,000 units) is expected to continue being reflected in thehigh level of building completions in the coming period. The global economy: Data that became available this month indicate improvement in economic activity in advanced economies and a continued slowdown in emerging economies. A process of divergence has begun between the monetary policies of the major blocs: the US Federal Reserve began raising the federal funds rate, after seven years of it being near-zero, and the European Central Bank expanded its monetary accommodation. The US continued to present a positive picture in personal consumption, the services sector and the labor market, while there is continued weakness in the manufacturing sector: particularly in the mining and energy fields: and industrial production continues to contract. The number of new jobs created this month exceeded expectations, and the figures for previous months were revised upward. However, the number of positions in manufacturing continues to contract. The inflation environment remains low. The increase in the federal funds rate, by 0.25 percentage points, was in line with market expectations, and according to assessments, the federal funds rate will increase at a slower pace than in previous interest rate increase cycles. In the eurozone, there appears to be continued improvement in activity, and the ECB projects a slow increase in the growth rate in the coming years. The unemployment rate declined to 10.7 percent, and industrial production increased by 0.6 percent this month. The various indices of expectations are mostly positive, but political risks within the eurozone maypose a risk to continued recovery. The ECB reduced the interest rate on deposits by 10 basis points, extended the quantitative easing program by halfa year, increased the types of securities purchased under the program, andremained committed to accommodative measures in the future. With that, themarkets expected more accommodative measures. In Japan, there was a significant revision to the third quarter growth figures, and additional indicators (particularly the growth in investments) indicate the potential for someimprovement in the economy. Economic activity in the emerging markets continues to show weakness: against the background of political difficulties, dependence on commodity prices, the slowdown in China and other factors: and the World Bank's assessment is that they will grow at a low rate of 4 percent in 2015. Various indicators continue to point toward moderation in activity in most of the large economies. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil fell to $38, compared with $45 the previous month,and is at levels similar to those during the financial crisis. The prices of other commodities remained low, following declines in previous months. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for January 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. In view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, the Monetary Committee assesses that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The low inflation environment in the short term continues to be affected by factors of a one-off nature. Short-term inflation expectations declined again this month, in view of renewed declines in fuel prices worldwide and additional price reductions initiated by the government.Based on the Research Department's staff forecast, annual inflation is only expected to return to within the target range at the beginning of 2017. Medium and long-term (forward) expectations are entrenched within the target range. C 2B 7 Indicators that became available this month point to the recent period's growth environment, around 2.5 percent, continuing in the fourth quarter as well, and the effect of the security situation is limited mostly to tourism. Recent data on exports were positive, but do not compensate for the declines in previous months. Preliminary data from the Companies Survey indicate a slight improvement vis-C 3A 0-vis the third quarter. Despite a slight decline in very recent data on the employment rate, the picture presented by labor market data continues to be positive. TheResearch Department's forecast for GDP growth in 2016 was revised downward, to 2.8 percent, compared with 3.3 percent in the September forecast. C 2B 7 The picture of the global economy continues to indicate some improvement in activity in advanced economies, as opposed to the continued slowdown in emerging markets. The process of divergence between the monetary policy of the major blocs has begun: the US Federal Reservebegan raising the federal funds rate, in a process expected to be gradual,and the ECB enhanced its monetary accommodation. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on November 22, 2015, through December 25, 2015, the shekel weakened by about 0.4 against thedollar and in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by 2.9 percent against the euro. Since the beginning of the year there has been an effective appreciation of 7.1 percent. The development of the exchange rate since the beginning of year is weighing on growth of exports and the tradable sector, and is delaying the return of inflation to within the target range. C 2B 7 This month, the increase in home prices resumed, and they have increased by 6.9 percent over the past 12 months. The volume of new mortgages taken out remains high. In the third quarter, the elevated level of activity in the construction industry continued, and this is expected to continue to contribute to increasing supply. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target have increased, and the risks togrowth remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system,and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. ******* The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for January 2016 will be published on January 11, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for February 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. January 25, 2016. The main considerations behind the decision.
